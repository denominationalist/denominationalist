		<h2 style="margin-left:10px; margin-right:10px;">Religious Organizations in Poland and Ukraine</h2>
		<hr>
		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> Together, Poland and Ukraine represent two states which have emerged from communist undemocratic tyranny through the efforts of civil society. This force unifies citizens within states so that through their joined efforts, they provide organizations that reflect their collective passions and bind themselves in a fraternal nature. Civil society is defined by its composition of clubs of all different assortments, recreational groups for those engaged in sport or play, a wide variety of aid and relief organizations and associations, and perhaps most importantly in the case of Eastern Europe, faith-based or religious institutions. Religion, represented denominationally in the Eastern European states of Poland and Ukraine by the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Eastern Catholic faiths, found itself in an integral role in Eastern Europe during this time. Under the Soviet Union and the numerous communist governments of satellite states, religious institutions served as some of the principal organizations of objection to this system of governance. Resistance to totalitarian communism through the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Eastern Catholic Churches in the era of communism in Poland and Ukraine severely limited regime efforts for ideological hegemonization and the repression of intellectual freedom. It is without doubt that the central factor which diverted the Communist Party’s ideological control over the masses in Poland and the Ukraine is the unwavering religious faith held by the nations Christian majorities. Today, the demographics of Ukraine and Poland reflect this unwavering faith as over 90% of the population within these states report to be Christian4. Contrastly, the Soviet hierarchy’s Marxist-Leninist Scientific Atheist belief system (which they enforced in a militant manner through the destruction of numerous churches and the creation of anti-religious museums) was truly detached from the majority of those under their leadership who held the Christian Faith. This produced a common realization among the deeply religious people of Ukraine and Poland that they as a people were distinct from those who led them. Obviously these are not the fruits of democracy, a group of powerful individuals united in a minority ideology representing masses of people who hold a belief which diametrically conflicts with their citizens. The development of an “us versus them” mentality in Ukraine and Poland, especially one that was morality-based, came as a result of this conflict. Through the efforts of many martyrs and Saints in Ukraine and Poland from time time of communism to the time following communism’s collapse religious institutions have and continue to play an integral role in the continuing efforts for the cause of democracy in these states. Beginning in the era of communism in Poland and Ukraine to now, three decades following the collapse of communism: What is the necessary role that religious institutions as civil society organizations have and must play in order for the furtherance of democracy in Poland and Ukraine to be made manifest?
		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> Following the collapse of the Russian Empire in 1917, Ukraine was the first state to declare itself an independent nation. The Ukrainian intelligentsia and autonomous Ukrainian Orthodox Church were quick to leap out from imperial repression when the communists seized Moscow and murdered the previous leadership<sup>6</sup>. These Ukrainian nationalists worked tirelessly to celebrate their distinct cultural, religious, and linguistic heritage and traditions, which separate the Ukrainian “Little Russians” from Moscow-based Imperial Russian “Great Russia.” Their celebration was short lived, however, as the Russians once again reclaimed Ukraine in 1921 and ushered in great persecutions soon after to those who refused to relinquish their traditions in order to adopt a Soviet identity<sup>9</sup>. During this time, the main cathedral in Ukraine, St. Volodymyr’s Cathedral was gutted of its religious iconography and relics, and turned into an anti-religion museum displaying Marxist-Leninist Scientific Atheist propaganda<sup>7</sup>. These shocking occurrences did little to encourage the majority of Ukrainians to be supportive of their Soviet government. On the contrary, they display the deep rift between the Soviet authorities and the Ukrainian people. These events illustrate the beginning of communist repression against the liberties of faith-based organizations.
		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> In defiance of the religious oppression inflicted upon them by the Soviet Authorities, thousands of Ukrainians, known as the New Martyrs in Eastern Orthodoxy, lost their lives to the authorities for practicing their Faith openly and refusing to submit to the state religion or lack thereof being Marxist-Leninist Scientific Atheism<sup>3</sup>. Their resistance of the ideology inflicted upon them along with their continued commitment to the prescriptions of the Christian Faith displays the Soviet-resented societal plurality in Ukraine. Their belief system was powerful enough to motivate a significant number of individuals to break from the ideology inflicted upon them and exercise intellectual freedom in the face of oppression. While their plurality was met with force as it contradicted Soviet collective identity it was exercised nonetheless. 
		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> In answering the question of what role religion has played in the democratization of Ukraine, through their involvement in the detailed hearships, the role of the historian is first to be considered. The unique construct of sainthood and martyrdom that the Christian churches posses has been employed to wonderous effect in this regard. These constructs allow for a great deal of information about individuals to be conveyed to generations living in the present that have not experienced the persecution that those who suffered under totalitarian communism have. Through the martyrs of communism, the Eastern Catholic church as a teaching entity has the ability to preach on the system of government in Ukraine that predated their democracy. This is accomplished through reading testimonials of persecuted victims as well as bestowing titles on churches and other religious institutions with the names of the deceased. This allows for a wealth of information to be spread to generations now and to come about the effects of this undemocratic system lest they fall into totalitarian rule once more. 	
		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> The use of canonization to shed light on oppression was employed by the churches of Ukraine during and after the communist era.  On June 27, 2000, Pope John Paul II beatified the “twenty five Ukrainian Beati” individuals who were martyred through horrendous methods by Soviet authorities<sup>1</sup>. These beatified individuals include Joachim Senkivskyi who was boiled to death as well as Zenobius Kovalyk who was crucified. Through their beatification and perhaps subsequent canonization their memory will be eternalized. In performing actions such as these, the horrors that commenced under communism can and have been instructed to Ukrainians now. Along with these testimonies being instructed, extremism can also be condemned as it was the driving force behind the militant ideological action which led an undemocratic totalitarian communist regime to seize Ukraine. So too can violence as a means of protest be quelled through the accounts of the martyrs. Perhaps most importantly, the “us versus them” mentality which became a hallmark of life in Ukraine under the undemocratic Soviet regime can be highlighted as well. These ideas of extremism, violence, and a lack of representation are fundamentally undemocratic as rational persuasion, discussion, and representation of citizens are hallmarks of a true democracy. Religions can use their authoritative positions in the hearts and minds of Ukrainians to convey this information thus bringing citizens away from this undemocratic primitiveness. This comes with the added effect of directly aiding in the democratization of their land.
		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> Moving down the historical timeline to the first decade following communism in Ukraine, in a survey issued in 2004, when asked “which level of your trust is to charitable organizations and civic associations?”  49.8 percent of respondents stated that they do not trust those groups while a mere 15 percent said they did, the rest unsure8. This clearly displays a lack of faith in civil society in democratic Ukraine. The reason is undoubtedly the legacy of communism and the congruence between the previous regime which was responsible for the repression and oppression of Ukraininans and the organizations which it led. Convincing a society that the organizations what were previously led by a tyrannical government were safe to participate in requires a great deal of encouragement. Civil society is often thought of as a third sector of society, detached from the public or state based institutions as well the for-profit private industries. However, in Eastern Europe under communism this detachment was not present. The totalitarian nature of communism extended into this third sector and replaced civil society with quasi state controlled organizations all built on or out of the party-state bureaucracy. Therefore, following its leave of communism, a weak civil society characterized Ukraine as citizens had relied on the state, not themselves to provide these services. Because this third sector of society was unable to function as it should through its infiltration by the party-state bureaucracy, following Communism's collapse the legacy of a repressive regime dominating these organizations remained. This served as a great deterrent for individuals who wished to participate in civil society organizations.
		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> While the party-state takeover of civil society was characteristic of civil society in Ukraine, one crucial element of civil society that was spared from this process was religion. Within the first decade after the collapse of communism in Ukraine, religious organizations were greatly strengthened. This strengthening occurred to the degree that they in fact became the pinnacle of civil society participation. According to data from the State Committee on Nationality and Church Affairs in Ukraine in 2008, 74.7 percent of Ukrainians stated that they belonged to a religion or denomination<sup>10</sup>. This level of participation represents a stark contrast from the levels of religious participation from another earlier study which surveyed a smaller set of respondents in 1995. In this survey conducted thirteen years earlier, 3.7 percent of respondents stated that they were members of a religious or church organization8. From 1985 to the year 2002 the number of church organizations in Ukraine increased from 6,252 to 28,383<sup>10</sup>. This could potentially lead one to believe that the rise in accessibility aided membership in some degree as the number accessible places of worship and organizations to be members of quadrupled. However, this still does not show the conscious of the ordinary Ukrainian citizen of whom the rise in religious participation should be credited. It is the citizens of states who compose civil societies and it is observable that the majority of citizens in the Ukraine themselves underwent a conversion of mind. This enabled this great increase in civil society participation and creation. To gauge this conversion of mind, sociological surveys conducted within Ukraine display the mindset of Ukrainian citizens on matters of their faith. Data from the same committee on Nationality and Church Affairs of Ukraine displayed that 51.5 percent of Ukrainians see religion as “an important asset for the democratization of society” <sup>10</sup>. Within the majority consensus for this statement, the answer to the question of conversion of mind in Ukraine is found. The fantastic increase in religious participation and organizational creation in Ukraine in the twenty first century can be compared to a long sigh following constriction from non democratic forces for decades. The Ukrainian people now armed with democracy and its product of liberty and collective rights are able to exercise their liberty in participating in an organization that like democracy was deprived of them in their totalitarian nation. As a product of this, those generations who belonged to that era of persecution now raise their generations in an era which will make good use of liberties that the previous generations were so restricted from attaining, chiefest among these liberties is the practice of religion. The rapid growth experienced by the churches of Ukraine in the same span of time that other civil society organizations have suffered extensively from the effects of their communist legacy is unprecedented. This role that Ukrainians see the Church in taking up, the safeguarders of democracy, is one of great importance as it reflects their trust in the faith. It is imperative that the churches of Ukraine continue to maintain their opposition of totalitarian regimes as membership continues to increase. This is something that can be relied on as the social positions of the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches rarely change.
		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> Resulting from their detachment from the communist party-state bureaucracy in Ukraine, religious organizations are correctly labeled, as previously mentioned, their pinnacle of civil society. This results entirely from the trust that the population of Ukraine’s affords them as organizations detached from communist control. The Eastern Orthodox and Catholic churches which operate in Ukraine have been credited with aiding in the country’s democratization, therefore they are using the trust they have gained from the citizens of Ukraine for the advancement of democracy in their nation as well as the proliferation of speech against tyranny as it relates to totalitarian communism. This is exactly the role they should be playing for the advancement of democratization in Ukraine. The fall of communism and the subsequent establishment of democracy in Ukraine has given the churches profound levels of freedom. Therefore, it is in the best interest of these organizations, in an effort to gain less martyrdoms in the age to come, to continue to promote the system of government which has allowed for the proliferation in participants.		
		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> For Poland, persecution of religion and the ideology of Marxist-Leninist Scientific Atheism were equally in no sense as significant as they were in Ukraine during their era of communism. Therefore, the plight of communism was significantly less destructive (in terms of martyrdoms) compared to what unfolded in Ukraine. During the time that communism reigned in Poland, the Roman Catholic Church, later headed by the Polish born Pope John Paul II, was a staunch opponent to the undemocratic authoritarian system that was imposed upon the people there<sup>1A</sup>. Therefore, its legacy moving into the future is one of initial and complete support for the overthrow of undemocratic regimes. Much like Ukraine, the people of Poland greatly suffered under communism. Much like within Ukraine (and no doubt due to the Roman Catholic faith of the Polish people) an “us versus them” mentality developed pinning the Polish nation against the Soviet-backed party-state. Ironically, in many instances when tension developed between the Polish people and the State, the Catholic Church would serve as a “mediator” in their struggle<sup>2</sup>. Ironic as it might be the union between the government and the Catholic Church in this sense allowed for pluralism to work its way into the areas of control within the communist government. The addition of the Catholic Church as a mediator greatly strengthened its position within Poland as increased in pluralism whenever they can be attained serve to chip away at the homogenization imposed on the ruling structure by the state.
		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> With the election of Archbishop Karol Józef Wojtyła of Kraków- a Polish native- to the Papacy in 1978 as John Paul II, the ideological and societal tensions between the Polish nation and State were irreversibly destined for inevitable collision.  It was the Roman Catholic Church led by Pope John Paul II, along with the civil society organization Solidarity Union, which irrefutable led to the inevitable collapse of the communist system in Poland<sup>1A</sup>. Through his various trips back home to Poland wherein he engaged with the Polish people through massive open air masses, John Paul II expressed his support for the communist opposition Solidarity labor movement. At its peak, Solidarity was composed of some 10 million individuals making up the vast majority of the employed workforce<sup>2</sup>. Solidarity’s very existence clearly shows the lack of hegemony and totalitarian footing Poland possessed at this time. This resistance movement in union with a Polish Pope shows the ill-fated future for the communist State in Poland. For this reason, the election of John Paul II was so crucial for the democratization of Poland. He himself, a Pole, understood that the system foisted onto his people was not a product of their own democratic free choices. Therefore, his works and words strongly reflected this fact. In his encyclical Sollicitudo Rei Socialis, he highlights the lack of power in the hands of citizens through conditions not of their own choosing but by the structure of their governments, highlighting that people are shut out of the democratic process in saying:		
		<p style="margin-left:100px; margin-right:100px; text-indent:0px;"> Nations need to reform certain unjust structures, and in particular their political institutions, in order to replace corrupt, dictatorial and authoritarian forms of government by democratic and participatory ones. This is a process which we hope will spread and grow stronger. For the "health" of a political community - as expressed in the free and responsible participation of all citizens in public affairs<sup>5.
		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> In this direct call for democracy, Pope John Paul II highlights the need for reform in nations who are oppressed by “dictatorial authoritarian forms of government.” This is no doubt a blow against the communist system he came from, issued in 1987.  Statements such as these are excellent  representations of the necessary role that the Church has played in order for democracy to be made manifest in Poland. The position of the Pope and his audience also greatly aids in his denunciation of the unfair, unjust, and undemocratic plight he gave witness to as those behind the Iron Curtain were seldom given a voice.
		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> While they both work toward the same goal, in Poland, the examples of the living as represented by Pope John Paul II in supporting the democratization of Poland contrast greatly with the aforementioned examples of the deceased martyrs in Ukraine. In terms of effectiveness, the works of the living seem to behave more favorably as they are immediate in their condemnation of the undemocratic system. One of the main inhibitors to totalitarian rule in Poland that the Ukraine did not share in was the structure of the Roman Catholic Church in that state. Unlike the Eastern Church in Ukraine, the Roman Catholic Church’s highest authority, the Pope, lived outside of communist Eastern Europe. Therefore, the Church (represented greatly in this sense by the Pope) as a “formal organization with a transnational base” was able to staunchly maintain their position of opposition to communism from abroad within the confines of the Vatican without the immediate risk of martyrdom<sup>2</sup>. This also means that the Church in Poland could not be constrained by the will of any party. Both Polish and Ukrainian Christians are united in that, loyal first to their Faith, they both accepted first the ideology taught by their belief system instead of that which was espoused by their communist government. In furtherance of this, the domestic Catholic Church within Poland maintained a level of autonomy which allowed it “to resist its and the Polish nation’s full incorporation into totalitarian structures”<sup>2</sup>. Unlike other communist states during the 1950s especially Ukraine, the Polish government allowed for religious education to be taught in public schools<sup>2</sup>. Any form of public religious education is of course contrary to the prescriptive ideology of Marxist-Leninist Scientific Atheism in any form. Therefore, its existence shows the lack of total ideological control that the state had over the Polish people. Along with religious education, the Catholic Church’s press was guaranteed to remain free from government control through an arrangement agreed upon by both the church and state<sup>2</sup>. A free church press translates to pluralism in every stretch of the word when in a communist state. All of these combined efforts clearly place strong limits on the state’s “goal of total ideological hegemony”<sup>2</sup>. In doing so, they not only display the level of societal pluralism present in Poland but also show the level of unrestrained intellectual freedom granted to them. This once again demonstrates the necessary role of the Church in this regard as an organization which lobbies for and succeeds in attaining separation from undemocratic constraints on civil society.
		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> Therefore, following the first decade after communism, religiosity remained high as it embodied the polish identity. It is important to note that this aspect of the Polish identity was preserved and undivided from the era of communism to the subsequent democratic transition. Therefore, Catholicism is a central part of “polishness” which is nearly impossible to be looked at independently from the Polish or downplayed. Within Poland, 92 percent of individuals belong to a religion or denomination<sup>10</sup>. Roman Catholicism makes up the vast majority of those who are religious with 87.58 percent of Polish citizens declaring themselves Catholics<sup>4A</sup>. Within Poland, as would be expected following their victory in bringing about the end of communism, the “most popular areas of expression of informal collective civic behaviour” happen to be church related<sup>1A</sup>. The parish, or the unit of a local Catholic church and its attendees in each community within Poland are the most frequented civil society organizations within the state. Therefore, civil society in Poland is greatly focused around their Church. It is obvious and perhaps an understatement to say that the people of Poland employ religion and its role in civil society as an exercise of their democratic freedom. The freedom to attend church and to worship openly was strengthened by democracy of course but this is not central to the question of why civil society organizations in Poland have been dominated by the Church. 
		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> There is more to the equation than sheer desire to exercise liberty, as is the case in Ukraine. In Poland, the Polish people employ their religion of Roman Catholicism which includes the vast majority of their civil society organizations to the effect that it continues to display the “polishness”of their state. A state that for the entirety of its history and in their annals of their history was inscribed within countless stories of invasion, repression, segregation, the splitting up of their land and so on. The Roman Catholic Church as previously stated can not be separated from the people of Poland as it is the one aspect of their statehood that has remained constant throughout history. Therefore, the Catholic Church which is consistent in being an organization composed of Poles, for Poles from the ages past and for centuries to come will continue to be a significant part of the Polish identity that lives on. This living identity therefore is vested with the civil society for cultural as well as national preservation. This powerful fact gives great insight into the democratic future of Poland. The Roman Catholic Church, an organization which fought for democracy in Poland and against the repression and oppression of the authoritarian commmunist system shares in the same historical capacity as Ukraine’s Church.Their role in civil society works to greatly educate the people of their nation in the terror that surrounds a fall from democracy and into authoritarian rule wherein the people have the potential of once again watching their leaders greatly distance themselves from the people they are meant to represent.

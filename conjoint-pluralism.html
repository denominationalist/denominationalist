		<hr>
		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> Internal resistance to totalitarian communism through cultural pluralism severely limited regime efforts for ideological hegemonization and the repression of intellectual freedom in communist Poland and Ukraine. One central factor which diverted the Communist Party’s ideological control over the masses in Poland and the Ukraine is the unwavering religious faith held by the nations Orthodox Christian and Roman Catholic majorities. The Soviet hierarchy’s Marxist-Leninist Scientific Atheist belief system (which they enforced in a militant manner through the destruction of numerous churches and the creation of anti-religious museums) truly detached them from the majority of those under their leadership who held the Christian Faith. To this extent, the societal rift between the ruling class and the people in both countries was in part the fault of this ideology which both encompassed the entire party-state system and served as a prerequisite to power in most cases. How does one reconcile this and what balancing act must be performed in order for this rift to be stabilized? This question was never answered during the time that communism ruled in Eastern Europe. However, its effect, the common realization of the people of Ukraine and Poland that they as a people were distinct from those who led them embedded within them a sense of detachment which propelled them directly to social alienation of the leadership and an “us versus them” mentality flourished as the leadership detached themselves from the people
		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> The development of an “us versus them” mentality in Ukraine, especially one that was morality-based, came quite gradually for Ukrainians. Russia and the Ukraine, unlike Russia and Roman Catholic Poland, were previously spiritually combined within the Russian Empire<sup>3</sup>. Both the Moscow based Tsar and the Russian Orthodox Church’s Holy Synod of Bishops and their Ukrainian metropolitanate had a political and spiritual monopoly over the Orthodox Christian Ukrainian people<sup>5</sup>. Moscow’s control over Ukraine was in some ways more comfortable for them as it was familiar. However this retention of geographic leadership taken from Tsarist days is not to be mistaken for total acceptance of Moscow’s rule. Following the collapse of the Russian Empire in 1917, Ukraine was the first state to declare itself an independent country. The Ukrainian intelligentsia and autonomous Ukrainian Orthodox Church were quick to leap out from imperial repression when the communists seized Moscow and murdered the previous leadership<sup>5</sup>. These Ukrainian nationalists worked tirelessly to celebrate their distinct cultural, religious, and linguistic heritage and traditions, which separate the Ukrainian “Little Russians” from Moscow-based Imperial Russian “Great Russia.” Their celebration was short lived, however, as the Russians once again reclaimed Ukraine in 1921 and ushered in great persecutions soon after to those who refused to relinquish their traditions in order to adopt a Soviet identity<sup>7</sup>. During this time, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church was dismantled and in its place a Soviet-tolerated Russian Orthodox Church was foisted onto the Ukrainian people governed by a Patriarch confirmed by the Soviet state<sup>3</sup>. During this time, the main cathedral in Ukraine, St. Volodymyr’s Cathedral was gutted of its religious iconography and relics, and turned into an anti-religion museum displaying Marxist-Leninist Scientific Atheist propaganda<sup>6</sup>. These shocking occurrences did little to encourage the majority of Ukrainians to be supportive of their Soviet government. On the contrary, they display the deep rift between the Soviet authorities and the Ukrainian people.
		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> In defiance of the religious oppression inflicted upon them by the Soviet Authorities, thousands of Ukrainians, known as the New Martyrs in Eastern Orthodoxy, lost their lives to the authorities for practicing their Faith openly and refusing to submit to the state religion or lack thereof being Marxist-Leninist Scientific Atheism<sup>4</sup>. Their resistance to the ideology inflicted upon them- along with their continued commitment to the prescriptions of the Christian Faith- displays the Soviet-resented societal plurality in Ukraine. Their belief system was powerful enough to motivate a significant number of individuals to break from the ideology inflicted upon them and exercise intellectual freedom in the face of oppression. While their plurality was met with force as it contradicted Soviet collective identity it was exercised nonetheless.
		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> One of the main inhibitors to totalitarian rule in Poland was the Roman Catholic Church. Unlike the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine, the Roman Catholic Church’s highest authority, the Pope, lived outside of communist Eastern Europe. Therefore, the Supreme Pontiff and the Curia of the Holy Roman Church with their own interests in mind could not be swayed by the domestic politics of the Polish state as in Ukraine. The Roman Catholic Church was able to staunchly maintain their position of opposition to communism from abroad within the confines of the Vatican and work against communism in safety. This means that the Church in Poland could not be constrained by the will of the party and if some churchmen choose to accept some communist doctrine they could easily be rebuked by the Church abroad. However, while this slight difference in terms of the governance of the churches divides both the Polish and Ukrainian Christians they are united in that Polish Catholics as Ukrainian Orthodox Christians, loyal first to their Faith, accepted first the ideology taught by their belief system instead of that which was espoused by their communist government. In furtherance of this, the domestic Catholic Church within Poland maintained a level of autonomy which allowed it “to resist its and the Polish nation’s full incorporation into totalitarian structures”<sup>2</sup>. Unlike other communist states during the 1950s especially Ukraine, the Polish government allowed for religious education to be taught in public schools<sup>2</sup>. Any form of public religious education is of course contrary to the prescriptive ideology of Marxist-Leninist Scientific Atheism in any form. Therefore, its existence shows the lack of total ideological control that the state had over the Polish people. Along with religious education, the Catholic Church’s press was guaranteed to remain free from government control through an arrangement agreed upon by both the church and state<sup>2</sup>. A free church press translates to pluralism in every stretch of the word when in a communist state. All of these combined efforts clearly place strong limits on the state’s “goal of total ideological hegemony”<sup>2</sup>. In doing so, they not only display the level of societal pluralism present in Poland but also show the level of unrestrained intellectual freedom granted to them. Much like within Ukraine (and no doubt due to the Roman Catholic faith of the Polish people) an “us versus them” mentality developed pinning the Polish nation against the Soviet-backed party-state. Ironically, in many instances when tension developed between the Polish people and the State, the Catholic Church would serve as a “mediator” in their struggle<sup>2</sup>. With the election of Archbishop Karol Józef Wojtyła of Kraków- a Polish native- to the Papacy in 1978 as John Paul II, the ideological and societal tensions between the Polish nation and State were irreversibly destined for inevitable collision. Through his various trips back home to Poland wherein he engaged with the Polish people through massive open air masses, John Paul II expressed his support for the communist's opposition, the Solidarity labor movement<sup>1</sup>. At its peak, Solidarity was composed of some 10 million individuals making up the vast majority of the employed workforce<sup>2</sup>. Solidarity’s very existence clearly shows the lack of hegemony and totalitarian footing Poland possessed at this time. This resistance movement in union with a Polish Pope shows the ill-fated future for the communist State in Poland. 
		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> United in a common cultural or religious worldview which differed from that expressed by the party-states of Poland and the Ukraine, these two countries found their people at odds with the ruling establishment. This religious worldview and its inability to coexist neatly with Soviet ideology created a certain degree of societal pluralism grounded in both faith and the rejection of hegemonic establishment ideology. Both Poland and the Ukraine represent two countries which during this time period of transition profited in varying degrees from their previously discussed pluralism. The societal rifts which existed within both countries between the ruling class and the national unit allowed for a defense against total totalitarianism in the case of Poland and a defense against the mass acceptance of the communist ideology in the case of Ukraine. Both countries and their respective majority religious institutions were not structured equally, as is clearly seen in comparing the Roman Catholic Church and the Ukrainian Russian Orthodox Church. However, in the end it was really the central message behind them and the belief of the adherents rather than the political control of their institutions which differentiated them from the communists in both countries thus creating pluralism. In both countries, the tension between the faith based organizations and belief systems displayed with profound clarity the “us versus them” mentality which dominated life there.

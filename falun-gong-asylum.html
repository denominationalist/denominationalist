		<hr>
		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> When confronted with the grave reality that sovereign states can, and often do, commit and inflict heinous acts upon their citizens— crimes which are universally appalling and run into conflict with our innermost understanding of justice— the states of Earth decided it right and just to afford certain protections which allow those persecuted abroad to find peace in another place, safeguarding their human rights. In 1951, the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees did just that. This convention gave a defined name to those who sought refuge from the situations previously described, refugees. Specifically, it said that these refugees are those:
    <p style="margin-left:90px; margin-right:70px;"> “...who owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside of the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.”<sup>1</sup>
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> Twenty nine years after this, in 1980, the United States incorporated this understanding into its domestic laws through the Refugee Act. Furthermore, the U.S. incorporated the principle of non-refoulement in which “no country should return a refugee to a country where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion."<sup>1</sup> Through these guaranteed protections, the ability for those who are fleeing their state through persecutions to their aforementioned identities is not only lawful but is assured through non-refoulement and presented in such a way so as to encourage those who are genuine to indiscriminately find refuge in the United States of America. In the face of this legislation and the perception of encouragement it emanates, these claims are sorrowfully inaccurate. This is best exemplified in the case of those who practice Falun Gong.
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> Falun Dafa or Falun Gong (both acceptable) is a method of cultivation (similar to Qigong) which focuses heavily on the Falun or Law Wheel found in many practices including the Buddhist tradition. In Qigong, Qi cultivation is a process through which practitioners contort into various postures, stances, as well as hand and body movements in an effort to cultivate life-energy through their exercises. This is a tradition going back thousands of years and is practiced, according to the beliefs of practitioners, to improve their general wellness. For Falun Dafa practitioners, their cultivation is of an exceedingly higher level, focused on the three principles of the universe: Truthfulness, Compassion, and Forbearance. Aside from benefits to their health brought on by the exercises, followers of Falun Dafa do so to strengthen their pursuit of moral living. In 1992, in the People's Democratic Republic of China, Teacher-Master Li Hongzhi began teaching Falun Dafa as a means of promoting the health of his adherents as well as orienting their lives toward his perception of moral good, grounded in centuries of traditional thought. Falun Gong, as it is taught by Master Li, is not only a way to attain physical wellbeing but also salvation. Followers of Falun Dafa live by the creed of Truthfulness, Compassion, and Forbearance and use this model in union with the theology and cosmology of Master Li as a structural guide for their lives.<sup>2</sup>
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> Immediately, Falun Gong flourished in the People’s Democratic Republic. By the seventh year since its foundation, Falun Gong practitioners numbered 70 to 100 million in China- a figure far exceeding Communist Party membership. When these numbers were reported to the ruling regime, it was determined that Falun Gong “conflicted with principles underpinning Marxist ideology and the legitimacy of CCP rule” and thus a brutal crackdown ensued resulting in the movement's public ban.<sup>3</sup> On July 22, 1999 China’s Ministry of Public Security declared the practice of Falun Gong to be against the law in China.<sup>4</sup> At this time, public broadcasts were sent out condemning the practice. Those who were caught practicing Falun Gong were arrested and millions were forced to recant their belief in the practice.
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> According to Freedom House, a non-governmental organization which advocates for freedom throughout the world, “hundreds of thousands” of Falun Gong practitioners have been detained by the regime and sent to “labor camps and prisons, where they were subjected to horrific forms of torture” because of their practice.<sup>3</sup> This is an official action plan of the Chinese Communist Party, resulting from the establishment of the “610 Office.” This body or agency was constructed by the Chinese regime for the purpose of persecuting Falun Gong, a ‘heretical sect’ and ‘true cult’ according to the state.<sup>4</sup> Freedom House reports that the 610 Office subjects practitioners who are caught to intense mental and physical torture including, “videos slandering Falun Gong and its founder, sleep deprivation, beatings, stretching in awkward postures for long periods of time, and shocks with electric batons, including to the breasts and genitals.”
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> At the start of these persecutions, Human Rights Watch, an international non-governmental organization which advocates for human rights, reported that under Chinese law (specifically Article 300) Falun Gong practitioners can be given a minimum sentence of seven years, imprisonment, or death for the crime of continuing to practice the faith.<sup>4</sup>  The intimidation methods and various other tools of persecution employed by the Chinese regime do not, however, appear to be entirely effective as millions of people in China continue to practice Falun Gong even today, knowing the consequences of their actions.<sup>6</sup> The worst forms of persecution, however, render Dafa disciples unable to continue the practice; the chiefest among those being forced organ harvesting, rendering death. According to the China Tribunal, a non-governmental tribunal established by the International Coalition to End Transplant Abuse in China, Falun Gong practitioners are used as a commodity as “the principal source - of organs for forced organ harvesting” in China.<sup5</sup> The healthy lifestyle of cultivators who abstain from smoking and consuming alcohol and practice routine exercise and meditation renders their organs highly sought after in the realm of forced organ harvesting, especially with regard to transplant tourism.<sup>6</sup> It was the judgment of the Tribunal, headed by the prosecutor of Slobodan Milošević- Sir Geoffrey Nice, that the Chinese regime was guilty of crimes against humanity for their forced harvesting of Falun Gong prisoners of conscience in accord with the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.<sup5</sup>
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> Principally, as a result of the ongoing persecutions against practitioners of Falun Gong, members of the movement have immigrated to the United States. Their stories of brutal persecution and torture were recieved with intregue and scrutiny and as such were evaluated by numerous bodies in the United States government. The 2019 Report on International Religious Freedom for China issued by the United States Department of State echoes the findings of the Chine Tribunal, citing its conclusion that the Chinese regime engages in organ harvesting of practitioners.<sup>7</sup> In the same manner, it offers reports of Chinese authorities arresting thousands of practitioners of Falun Gong that year.<sup>7</sup> In his statement on the 21st Anniversary of the PRC Government’s Persecution of Falun Gong on July 20, 2020, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called on the People’s Democratic Republic to “immediately end its depraved abuse and mistreatment of Falun Gong practitioners” (Pompeo). Both houses of congress the Senate and House of Representatives have independently introduced and voted on numerous resolutions which stand in “solidarity” with practitioners of Falun Gong and condemn their “persecution.”
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> Human Rights Watch, Freedom House, the China Tribunal, both houses of Congress, the United States Department of State, and its Secretary have all agreed that Falun Gong practitioners are being persecuted on account of their religious practices in the People’s Democratic Republic of China. If one considers the breadth and depth of the literature presented, they would think of Falun Gong practitioners as an easy case study into how those persecuted for their religion are accepted as refugees through the U.S. asylum process. However, in the United States those practitioners who are seeking asylum do not find the task to be easy. On the contrary, many practitioners find themselves entrenched in a system with structural faults which prevent their stories of persecution from being heard and honored. In fact, of those Falun Gong practitioners seeking asylum who are accepted, it is often through tireless work on their part with intense resistance from the state throughout the process, including denials of their status as refugees along the way. Given that the reality of ongoing persecution against Falun Gong practitioners is accepted by numerous governmental agencies and NGOs in the U.S. what does the fact that Falun Gong applicants for asylum are still being denied in the United States say about our asylum process?
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> In this paper I will argue that there are three aspects of the U.S. asylum process which lead to this surprising outcome. The process of seeking asylum in the United States carries the baggage of modifications which have fundamentally degraded the asylum system in their wake. Therefore, I will first delve into the process of Expedited Removal, a pernicious addition to the immigration procedures of the United States. It is through this development that individuals seized after entering into the U.S. are quickly expelled from the country without due process and, in many cases, never afforded the guaranteed right to hear their asylum claims. Secondly, the constructed importance of one’s narrative credibility, wherein victims of persecution are scrutinized to give an acceptable version of the hardship they suffered or else face being sent back to the site of persecution from whence one fled. Tertiarily, systemic issues exist wherein time is used against applications. These applications through deadlines limit the ability for justice to be afforded applicants.
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> With the sole purpose of establishing this claim as credible through objective means, in this work’s first section, I will present the faults of expedited removal. This will be accomplished by employing relevant literature from several scholars. These academics write not only with juridic credibility on the letter of the law, as some are of the field, but they also write with eminence on the implications of the law and its empirical effects, observable in their research. The second section of this work utilizes both academic research as well as a court case in an effort to show the struggle of attaining asylum within the United States. It is in displaying this struggle that the false and damaging construct of narrative credibility can be highlighted as a hindrance to the enactment of justice. This construct will be shown only to encourage a simple narrative of almost cliche persecution, requiring a shallow generalized tale absent of the nuance of one’s sui generis lived experience of persecution. The third and final section of this work will call to mind the use of time in the asylum process. Through looking over current deadlines in the asylum process and employing a case coupled with academic literature, time will be shown to work against both logic and the delivery of justice.
    <p style="margin-left:10px; margin-right:10px; text-indent:10px;"><b>Section I - Expedited Removal</b>
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> Expedience in one’s trial has been traditionally praised in the United States. Speedy trials are desirable in that they do not draw out for nefarious purposes litigation which keeps citizens detained and far from a just determination of their fate. An integral clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and known as a right afforded to citizens in the Bill of Rights, expedience for citizens is venerable in its position within the structure of the legal system within the U.S. For noncitizens, however, expedience does not share the same positive acclaim or worshipful position in connection with any enumerated rights or determinant justice. Far from this, a distinction for noncitizens is made by which the only aspect of expedience afforded them is a swift departure from the premises, a deportation. In 1996 the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRAIRA) created an expedient tool to be utilized by immigration officials in the United States which accomplishes this afforded ‘kick out the door.'<sup>8</sup> The tool is known as Expedited Removal (ER) and since its creation under the administration of United States President Bill Cliton, ER has been expanded upon by succeeding administrations, each time increasing its power to expel immigrants as they enter.
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> ER initially under the IIRAIRA was limited in that it only gave authority to immigration officials to remove undocumented individuals from “ports of entry."<sup>8</sup> It was further expanded in 2002 to encompass “non-Cuban aliens who, within two years prior to apprehension, entered the United States by sea.” However, this was not the last swell of power attained by the tool and on August 11, 2004, the Secretary of Homeland Security once again expanded ER now to border agents who “apprehend aliens within 100 miles of the border within 14 days after an entry without inspection.” Expedited Removal functions as follows: First, individuals entering into the United States are inspected by Customs and Border Patrol officers (CBP) who determine if individuals entering possess the proper paperwork. Following this, if the paperwork is not available individuals are given a secondary inspection wherein they can make a credible fear determination stating they are at fear of persecution. Those detained then enter into the custody of the Imigration and Naturalization Service (INS) where finally they are afforded the opportunity to consult an attorney. Following this, detainees would be given an Exclusion Hearing held by Immigration Judge (IJ). Based on the determination of the IJ, asylum seekers could either be accepted or denied. If they are denied they have the opportunity to appeal this judgement to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA).<sup>8</sup>
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> It should come as no surprise that ER is absolutely detrimental to the idea of asylum seekers attaining refuge with ease. This is a process that by design removes individuals from the United States and sends them back from whence they came. This process, when applied to refugees, is obviously against the aforementioned laws on refoulement. Verily, it must be understood that Falun Gong practitioners who are sent back to China will suffer immensely at the cost of ER. As a policy, Expedited Removal is cloaked by an alleged intention to defer those who make dubious claims justifying their illegal entry. However, in effect this practice grossly discriminates against those seeking asylum, especially those credibility seeking it. There is an important distinction to be made here, one that must be reflected on intently. ER by virtue of its statutes targets those truly seeking asylum out of valid concern over those who are falsifying their claims. When an individual enters into the United States through clandestine means they are to be met by a Customs and Border Patrol officer who is tasked with inspecting them for proper paperwork. This usually occurs at an airport in the case of practitioners of Falun Gong who arrive via the People’s Democratic Republic of China by plane. Under the statutes, ER “expressly” authorizes inspection agents “to deny admission to persons who arrive at an airport… who carry documents that CBP officials suspect have been procured through fraud.... without further hearing or review.”<sup>9</sup> In the case of Falun Gong practitioners or any refugees who are fleeing persecution in a state which is actively persecuting them, targeting them directly, the ways in which individuals leave are more often than not by some illicit means. In a state that is targeting religious adherents for death in the most severe cases, valid passports and identification documents are not obtainable. It is directly against the interests of the state to issue valid documents to those seeking to flee a country. It is entirely in the interests of those fleeing a state to produce false documents in their quest to flee. This is, however, not the only immensely problematic statute in ER. If individuals are removed either through a fault by immigration officials in not understanding or heeding their plea for asylum they face a mandatory five-year bar on returning to the United States.<sup>9</sup> This means that if a Falun Gong practitioner by some grace enters the United States, having fled a global superpower with intent to destroy adherents, and their claims are not regarded they will be sent back and if they return with a desire to make their case once more- even through official means- they will be indefinitely barred from ever entering the United States.<sup>9</sup>
    <p style="margin-left:10px; margin-right:10px; text-indent:10px;"><b>Section II - Narrative Credibility</b>
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> Blatant injustice is not only an offence to those who suffer its consequences, it is also a visible representation of structural and procedural faults. In reviewing numerous cases of Falun Gong practitioners who have had their asylum applications denied at various levels of the process, only to be rereviewed and accepted at a later date citing faults in the judgments of government officials, these issues can be brought to light in hopes that they may be remedied. According to Paul Gewirtz, a scholar of law and literature:
    <p style="margin-left:90px; margin-right:70px;"> “the goal of storytelling in law is to persuade an official decision-maker that one’s story is true, to win the case, and thus to invoke the coercive force of the state on one’s behalf.”<sup>10</sup>
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> Perhaps the greatest case which affirms the importance of storytelling in the United States asylum process is the story of Shunfu Li. In 2001, Li arrived in the United States from the People’s Demcratic Republic of China. Upon arrival, Li petitioned withholding of removal, asylum, and relief under the Covnetion Against Torture. As a member of Falun Gong, she was clearly immigrating out of fear of persecution for her faith. In China, according to the testimony of Li, she was subjected to torture and imprisoned. Upon her release from custody in China, Li faced intense social consequences for her membership in Falun Gong. She was demoted from a position at her place of work and ordered to take up a janitorial position. In an effort to display the lived experience of persecution she suffered, Li presented multiple warrants for her arrest issued before and following her departure from China. Similarly, Li produced a receipt of items seized from her possession by the Chinese state. The warrants affirmed that the reason for her arrest was that she was a director of  “Qingnianbu practice station” a park where practitioners of Falun Gong met to engage in their exercises.<sup>11</sup> Similarly, she had printed out documents from www.religioustolerance.org in an effort to show that Falun Gong was not a cult, run by a leader as the CCP had stated. She attempted to demonstrate that “Falun Gong is not involved with politics or against any government” as one piece of information she printed stated.
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> Following the presentation of her testimony and evidence, Li was denied asylum, withholding removal, and all other protections by the IJ. Despite the evidence she presented, the IJ targeted her credibility. Because the information she printed stated that there was no leadership structure in Falun Gong she was seen to be falsifying information by the IJ. Li described herself as a director, which was attested to by the warrants she produced. This conflicted greatly in the mind of the IJ with the claims that Falun Gong had no leader. In a formal case issued against the Attorney General by Li this was addressed. In her defense, another section of the website was displayed in which a quotation reading, "four top organizers were imprisoned in 1999,” was displayed, suggesting that the movement does in fact have an organizational structure which she was a member of.<sup>11</sup> It was clarified that by “director” she was referring to this organizational role and not a hierarchical position within the group as compared to most denominational faiths. This example shows a glimpse of the narrative battle being waged on the floor of the courtroom. The importance of even the smallest details, such as the use of the word ‘director’ as opposed to ‘organizer’ appear to carry great worth in this narrative battle. This was not the only point of contention expressed by the IJ, however. In a point raised even before this the IJ inquired of Li as a married woman why she had not submitted corroborative evidence from her husband. While Li did submit evidence from her arrests and the receipts from seized items, she failed to include any information from him. This seemed to carry eminent worth. According to Roland Barthes, a famed semiotician and author of “The Reality Effect,” details which might be discarded as useless carry great worth in that they “do the important work of making the narrative seem real.”<sup>10</sup> In the case against the AG, Li v. Mukasey Li was afforded the opportunity to clarify these two points which seemed to reduce her credibility to null, sewing doubts against her narrative. In the end, it was determined by the court that the IJ erred in her finding and Li’s application was resubmitted.
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> It is important to note that narrative and storytelling is not only found within the courtroom. In the journey that is attaining asylum, narrative greets those who embark before they step foot into the courtroom. As has been previously stated, the systems put in place which adversely limit asylum claims such as Expedited Removal do so through the use of testimony and stories early on. Just as IJ’s must search for narrative so too must CBP officers when they engage in their work. In 1994, just three years before the policy of Expedited Removal took effect there were 4,287 Custom and Border Protection officers employed by the U.S. government, prior to the office being merged with the Department of Homeland Security.<sup>12</sup> More recently, in 2016, the number of CBP officers employed by the DHS was at 19,828 persons and growing. In the same measure of time that the ranks have expanded nearly five times their size, constitutional violations, civil rights violations, and disciplinary violations such as misuse of force have exploded within the agency.<sup>12</sup> The rapid increase in numbers coupled by an increase in such violations is evidence of a lack of proper training afforded to officers, a troubling situation given their power. It seems CBP officers are relying on their own faculties as opposed to the precodres they are expected to be ordered by.
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> It is CBP officers who have the power to exercise great authority over those immigrating to the United States. Because of their jurisdictional authority over the border and a 100 mile radius surrounding it, they wield the ability to remove qualified persons at their discretion. Disciplinary infractions are not the only violations that CBP officers have been shown to engage in. Similarly, procedural adherence is also substantially lacking and should not come as a surprise under the assumption that training seems to be in decline given the record of violations. When officers first reprimand those who have entered into the United States through clandestine means they are required by law to take a sworn statement of the individual in custody regarding their intention of entrance. This statement, a narrative in its own right, is then also legally required to be read by the individual or read back to them by the officer. However,  in 72% of the cases surveyed by researchers empowered by Section 605 of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 “the alien neither read the statement, nor was the statement read back to him or her."<sup>8</sup> This lack of procedural adherence is greatly troubling in that if the information contained within the statement does not accurately depict their case, if the narrative is not credible, they are at great risk for deportation through perjury or to fall victim to the same initial fate as Shunfu Li. CBP officers detail the statements of those seeking asylum in credible fear determination documents. At the top of these documents there is printed an emboldened label which reads, “the following notes are not a verbatim transcript of this interview.”<sup>8</sup> This alone is greatly troubling, if minor details in the verbal testimony of Falun Gong practitioners are enough to declare their testimony not credible, what worth will the sworn written statements hold? It can only be expected that these documents will hold remarkable value.
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> Data from the same aforementioned study reveals that in approximately 48 percent of the reviewed cases, “INS trial attorneys use these statements to impeach the applicant’s testimony."<sup>8</sup> These statements then, the mere notes of officials lacking a full command of their position (as evidenced by violations in their duties), are what prevent human beings from intense persecution to the point of death abroad. Further data from the study shows that these statements have been referenced by IJs as the reason for denying a case 32 percent of the time, as reasonably expected.<sup>8</sup> This places practitioners in a very precarious position already, however, the danger is far from over. As was stated in the first section of this work, those seeking asylum are not afforded the ability to consult with- let alone receive aid from- an attorney until after these statements are made as these are issued under the second inspection. It is more than reasonable to conclude that without any legal advice the opportunity to not touch every point on the narrative checklist, to omit, or even to misspeak is exceedingly high.
    <p style="margin-left:10px; margin-right:10px;"><b> Section III - Time</b>
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> Procedural technicalities should never be determinant in the application of justice. This mantra could be seen as a banal platitude but it undoubtedly touches greatly upon a central issue in contention within the asylum process. The concept of time in the asylum process is appropriate so long as it is used to ensure an amicable pace of trial and the proper administration of proceedings. Where the line is drawn, however, is again in the application of justice. As previously stated through the process of ER, those detained are not allowed to be represented by an attorney during their credible fear interview.  This is a novel practice that originates outside of precedent before ER was introduced. Before IIRAIRA, those detained in the U.S. were allowed “a full hearing with the right to counsel, the right to present evidence, and to question witnesses on the record before an Immigration Judge.”<sup>8</sup> This, unfortunately for asylum seekers, is no longer the case and now a credible fear determination must be awaited before a lawyer is allowed to consult the detained. Therefore, if credible fear is not determined the ‘buck’ stops there. Similarly, through the process of Expedited Removal and the judgment of the United States Congress in enacting it, there exists a sixty-day time limit during which all challenges to the determinations of the IJ or BIA are to be heard.<sup>13</sup> After this sixty-day period no challenges can be raised. This is very problematic in that asylum judgements are definitively intimate and grave determinations. In that any contention produced following this arbitrary time of sixty-days is inadmissible and invalidated not on the basis of its veracity but precluded through a statutory limit, visible injustice can be concluded. Whether or not someone is truly at risk of persecution is therefore irrelevant.
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> Yun Wang, a practitioner of Falun Gong, made her way to the United States in 2004 after a period of living in hiding in the People’s Democratic Republic of China.<sup>14</sup> Before fleeing the state, Wang was imprisoned for three days and beaten as it was discovered that she not only practiced the banned faith, but also distributed materials relating to its practice.  Similarly, her father- who remained in China- was arrested and held by the Chinese authorities for two weeks after they had learned that she fled. After arriving in the United States and becoming discovered by U.S. authorities, Yun Wang submitted applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and withholding under the Convention Against Torture. However, because Wang submitted her application for asylum late (through an arbitrary time limit), it was determined by an immigration judge that she was disqualified from receiving asylum in the United States. The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed this judgement and solidified the ruling that Yun Wang, while believed to be a genuine practitioner, was disqualified from obtaining asylum. No adverse credibility declaration was made relating to her testimony of torture. However, it was noted in the argument of the IJ “[t]here was no medical attention required" after Wang was released from detention.<sup>14</sup> This was used in part to rule that Yun Wang did not suffer past persecution, an aspect of qualification in the process. Her bleeding mouth, swollen face, and bruises on her legs and arms did not constitute past persecution as Wang had no medical record of treating any of these ailments, citing that she could not afford treatment at the time. Upon further review of the case in a suit filed by Wang against the AG, it was determined that Wang, as a credible practitioner, did indeed have a well founded fear of persecution and her request for withholding of removal was approved. However, it was determined that the court did not have jurisdiction to overrule the judgement of the BIA and as such her asylum status could not be affirmed as well. Withholding of removal is the only aspect of her case which the court determined they had jurisdiction to decide and granted her the right to remain. It is clearly unreasonable that one can demonstrate a well founded fear of persecution in a ruling accepted in a suit against the U.S. attorney general yet fail to qualify for asylum status. The basis for being considered eligible for asylum is being a credible refugee. Yun Wang undoubtedly demonstrated a well founded fear of persecution. This is in total a procedural fault as an arbitrary deadline is being used to determine whether or not someone is eligible or entitled to a protection which was enacted to protect victims of persecution. Therein lies the issue at hand. Under every metric the testimony of Wang was seen as credible. A proper narrative was constructed and was not challenged by the IJ. Yet, asylum could not be granted because of an arbitrary duration of time. This is wholly dangerous in that it prevents the clear exercise of justice from being served. If Wang was not granted withholding of removal it is entirely possible if not a fact that she would be deported and barred from entry into the United States.
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> Practitioners of the meditative exercises of Falun Gong or Falun Dafa are victims of intense and  ongoing persecution in the People’s Democratic Republic of China. Not only do practitioners fear being tortured by authorities for engaging in their faith, they also fear horrendous crimes committed against them in the form of forced organ harvesting as prisoners of conscience. As a method of providing solace to those suffering on account of their faith, the process of asylum exists to afford human beings their due dignity when it can not be safeguarded in the country of their nativity or current occupancy. The United States asylum process, while codified in the domestic laws through the Refugee Act, is greatly lacking in its ability to provide the requisite solace needed by Falun Gong practitioners in some instances. Developments in United States law such as the evolution of Expedited Removal present difficulties for credible asylum seekers as has been demonstrated. Similarly, the legal system which adjudicates asylum claims is overly reliant on narrative evidence and the construction of stories. This seems to be greatly inappropriate given the ‘life or death’ nature of these claims and the errors present in the very nature of constructing narratives. Lastly, the use of time in the asylum process produces similar challenges, often to compound the aforementioned faults. Deadlines in the asylum process have been shown to limit the degree to which justice can be exercised. According to the first precept of Leventhal’s Theory of Procedural Justice, a widely utilized metric in the field of law and psychology combined, consistency is the preeminent hallmark of whether or not a system can be perceived as just.<sup>15</sup> In that the United States asylum process is plagued with appeals overturning the decisions of previous Immigration Boards or Immigration Justices, in that the system is so loosely constructed around the idea of narrative evidence and the opinions of low-level officials such as immigration officers, and are routinely corrected in federal lawsuits the metric of consistency can in no way be applied to these proceedings. This fact speaks regrettable volumes on the inability of the United States asylum system to be held accountable for the proper administration of what is just at present.

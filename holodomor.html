		<hr>
		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> My name is Christopher Bob. I am an American Ukrainian and a relative of individuals who endured and suffered the atrocious event that we call Holodomor. I am so glad to be able to discuss this seldom-spoken-of-event in the history of Eastern Europe under Communism. The first questions that I meet when I discuss Holodomor is simply, “what is it?” and “what does it mean?” So, to clear up any confusion or to educate any of you who do not yet know of this event, Holodomor refers to the starvation that millions of Ukrainians suffered and died through from 1932 to 1933. This starvation’s cause, which will be elaborated on further before our parting, is rooted in the policy decisions of Joseph Stalin. Stalin was the General Secretary or leader of the Soviet Union from 1929 to 1953. During this time, Ukraine found herself as a member of this undemocratic republic.  With regard to its meaning, Holodomor is a single word composed of the Ukrainian words морити and голодом, which when conjoined translate to “death |or extermination| by starvation.” Since its perpetration in 1932, Holodomor has been the subject of intense international debate with issues ranging from its causes, to its status as a genocide, and even its very existence. 
		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> Before recording this podcast, I had the pleasure of speaking with one survivor of Holodomor, Anastasia “Netty” Zoltonetsky who is still alive today at the age of 105. She corresponded with me to discuss the reality of this jarring event from her memory. We will briefly examine her story which begins when she was just 15 in 1929. It was during this year that Stalin’s farming policy known as collectivization reached her small, rural village in Ukraine. Collectivization, to those who do not study Soviet agricultural policy, calls for farms once owned by individual peasant families- known as “kulaks”- to be confiscated from them and turned over to the government for State ownership of the means of production.<sup>1</sup> Collectivized farms were intended to be used by the local population to maximize grain output. In 1932, when she was turning 18 Anastasia witnessed first hand the effects of the command of the Stalin-led government of the Soviet Union to increase “the grain procurement quota for Ukraine by 44%” through collectivization.<sup>2</sup> This is an astronomical number in terms of production capability even by today’s standard. Anastasia recalled the reaction of local farmers, many members of her own family, to be “we did not want this… we just wanted to farm as we always did on our own land.” At the same time that the order of collectivization was given, Ukrainian borders were sealed off by Soviet police “which prevented bread being brought back”3 into the country. This prevented Ukrainians from accessing food from outside of their country, shipments of food being brought in, and Ukrainians from fleeing Ukraine in order to escape the effects of the Soviet policy. At this point it is fairly obvious what the government was doing to the average Ukrainian. Increasing the quotas by an astonishing percentage while barring food to enter into the Ukrainian Republic would inevitably lead to starvation. 
		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> Beginning on 20 November 1932, Vyacheslav Molotov, a member of the Soviet Union’s Central Committee, forced legislation onto the government of Ukraine which called for “the confiscation grain and edibles and the repression of opposition.”<sup>4</sup> As such, the State began to confiscate all remaining food from the farms and homes within the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. The reason of such an order, while unknown to young Anastasia and most of the simple farmers who inhabited her village, is still debated till this day. However, the effects of these decisions are the death by starvation of at least 7 million Ukrainian men, women, and children in less than a year.<sup>5</sup> When reflecting on the initial stages of the food withdrawal from Ukraine by secret police and government officials, Anastasia states “they came into the homes. . . they took our food, every last jar was taken from us… all of the grain, all of the potatoes. . . they took it all after they took our wheat. We were left to die.” This feeling of abandonment is definitely not misplaced as the government, the system which is intended to protect its citizens outright turned against them. 
		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> The results of these commands for the most part are unspeakable. Anastasia describes the condition of those living around her from 1932 to 1933 as “existence without life.” She goes on to state that the vast majority of those around her perished through starvation very slowly. First, everyone would slowly lose weight until reduced to “bone and parchment skin.” After this their stomachs would swell as if the individual was pregnant. To my horror, she described an agonizing stomach ache that caused their bodies to convulse so intensely. Finally, death would “mercifully” take them and wagons would make their way from doorstep to doorstep to collect the daily dead almost like in Western Europe during the medieval black death. Anastasia states that some people who were loaded onto the carts were not even “fully dead… but there was no chance they would ever recover” and as such were taken away. In an effort to keep alive, Anastasia’s human instincts motivated her to consume anything she could. Without food, she ate “leaves, tree bark, and water” for the duration of the starvation while many resorted to cannibalism.<sup>6</sup>
		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> In the face of all this suffering, the Soviet Union’s leadership outright denied the existence of any famine or starvation within the Ukrainian Republic.<sup>7</sup>  While outright denial of Holodomor has not been extremely prevalent since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Soviet denial of Holodomor has a role in serving as reinforcement for believers like Anastasia who label its suppression as “a hallmark of genocide.” Many Ukrainians questioned the suppression of Holodomor discussion, going on to say that it was due to the governments full knowledge of Holodomor as Genocide in saying “why else would they force us not to speak of it, why else would they deny anyone died?” During the time of the famine, Maxim Litvinov the Soviet foreign minister is famous for the blunt statement that “there [was] no famine”  in Ukraine.<sup>7</sup> The direct denial of Holodomor by the Soviet Union continued into the latest stages of its rule. In 1983 the embassy of the Soviet Union in Canada released a statement directly denouncing the 50 year commemoration of Holodomor as “slanders against the USSR.”<sup>8</sup>
		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;">  Along with government denial of the famine, international aid organizations operating within the Soviet Union also denied the existence of the famine. They barred international aid from Ukraine despite the thousands of deaths each day. On 20 October 1932, the National Office of the Red Cross Society in Toronto received a statement which read,”... in view of the satisfactory harvest this year, the Executive Committee of the Alliance of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies of the USSR believes that the carrying out of the Canadian citizens’ proposal [to offer grain aid to Ukraine] is not necessary in the absence of real need.”<sup>9</sup> While millions of Ukrainians were being starved to death, the government responded by blocking international help. This outright denial of the existence of a famine in Ukraine is highly suspicious at least and a blatant cover up of intentional punishment to the Ukraine at best.
		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> On January 4th 2008, the State Duma of the Russian Federation, the successor state of the Moscow-based Soviet Union, decreed that a number of post soviet states including Ukraine “have suffered from the result of the famine caused by forced collectivization.”<sup>10</sup>  However, while the Federation acknowledges the death of “7 million” in 1932 and 1933 from malnutrition they, in the same statement, deny that genocide was the goal. The direct quotation for the pronouncement reads “this tragedy does not have and cannot have internationally established signs of genocide and should not be the subject of contemporary political speculation.”<sup>10</sup>   While the existence of famine in the Ukraine from 1932 to 1933 is now an undisputed fact, publically uncontested by any government, the question as to whether or not the Holodomor is a genocide is disputed. Article II of the Genocide convention of the United Nations defines a Genocide as a crime sharing a mental and physical element.<sup>11</sup> The mental is defined as the “intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.” While the physical encompasses into its definition “killing members of the group, causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group,” and “deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.”11 The physical element is easy to prove as the starvation obviously inflicted great harm and conditions that would lead to the destruction of the Ukrainian people. However, as we know, intent is always a little more difficult to prove. The intent behind Holodomor is that Joseph Stalin ordered the starvation in order to punish post-revolutionary “Ukrainian nationalism.”<sup>13</sup> As such, he commanded that the Ukrainian people suffer as a result of their cultural revival following the collapse of the Russian Empire. In the words of Joseph Stalin,  “if we do not correct the situation [Ukrainian nationalism] … we could lose Ukraine.”<sup>12</sup> The belief that Stalin’s goal of defeating Ukrainian Nationalism was the intent behind Holodomor is bolstered by his “devastating purge of the Ukrainian intelligentsia and the Ukrainian Communist party itself.”<sup>13</sup> 
		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> Today 16 United Nations countries: Australia, Canada, Colombia, Ecuador, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Ukraine, the United States, as well as Vatican city independently recognize Holodomor as a Genocide committed against the Ukrainian people.<sup>11</sup> As of March 14, 2018 through Senate Resolution 435 the United States “ recognizes the findings of the Commission on the Ukraine Famine as submitted to Congress on April 22, 1988, including that “Joseph Stalin and those around him committed genocide against the Ukrainians in 1932–1933.”<sup>14</sup> Recognition of this devastating event in history is central in dispelling the myth of a collective Soviet identity adopted freely by the territories of Great Russia: Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus.
		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> I hope that you enjoyed this installment and learned that the death through forced starvation of millions of individuals in Ukraine under Communism is a seriously overlooked reality. As such, this horrific event known as Holodomor requires a larger platform in order for the millions who perished to be recognized as victims of a government which completely abandoned its citizens and outright slaughtered them to suppress their unique identity. The Holodomor or “death by starvation” as it is translated to, is a powerful example of the horrors associated with government tyranny and the silencing of internal dissent. From 1932 to 1933 Ukrainians were used like pawns by Joseph Stalin to show the might of the Soviet Union against diversity of identity. As such, millions perished through the drastic increase of grain quotas which caused famine, the denial of international aid, the sealing off of the Ukrainian border against incoming food, the seizing of household grain supplies, and the execution and exilement of the Ukrainian ingelegencia. It is a fact that through these policies the Ukrainian people were victims of one of the largest Genocides in human history. Thank you for listening and learning about the shocking history of the Holodomor Genocide.

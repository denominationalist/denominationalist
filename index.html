		<hr>
		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> Together, Poland and Ukraine represent two states which have emerged from communist undemocratic tyranny through the efforts of civil society. This force unifies citizens within states so that through their joined efforts, they provide organizations that reflect their collective passions and bind themselves in a fraternal nature. Beginning in the era of communism in Poland and Ukraine to now, three decades following its collapse: What is the necessary role that religious institutions as civil society organizations have and must play in order for the furtherance of democracy to be made manifest?

		<hr>
		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> The Soviet Union was founded in direct protest of the authority structures of the past. One such structure was the Church which gave legitimization to the previous Tsarist government. Therefore, the leadership within the Soviet Union sought to delegitimize the legitimizer by attacking religion and discrediting it. In their efforts to remove religion from the public sphere 1) millions of clergy and lay faithful where put to death, imprisoned in GULAGs, and sent to mental hospitals 2) countless cathedrals, churches, and monasteries were destroyed 3) and in their place Atheist Museums of Anti-religion were established. This had an immense effect on the geography of the Soviet Union as is demonstrated by this presentation.

		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> In principio erat Verbum, et Verbum erat apud Deum, et Deus erat Verbum. Hoc erat in principio apud Deum. Omnia per ipsum facta sunt, et sine ipso factum est nihil quod factum est; in ipso vita erat, et vita erat lux hominum, et lux in tenebris lucet, et tenebrae eam non conprehenderunt. Fuit homo missus a Deo, cui nomen erat Iohannes; hic venit in testimonium ut testimonium perhiberet de lumine, ut omnes crederent per illum. Non erat ille lux, sed ut testimonium perhiberet de lumine. Erat lux vera, quae inluminat omnem hominem, venientem in mundum. In mundo erat, et mundus per ipsum factus est, et mundus eum non cognovit. In propria venit, et sui eum non receperunt. Quotquot autem receperunt eum, dedit eis potestatem filios Dei fieri, his, qui credunt in nomine eius, qui non ex sanguinibus neque ex voluntate carnis neque ex voluntate viri, sed ex Deo nati sunt. Et Verbum caro factum est et habitavit in nobis; et vidimus gloriam eius, gloriam quasi unigeniti a Patre, plenum gratiae et veritatis.

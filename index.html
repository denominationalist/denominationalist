		<hr>
		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> Currently, the People’s Democratic Republic of China is involved in an international investment known as the Belt and Road Initiative. This initiative involves China expanding its influence over the Belt and Road region, a historic region practically synonymous with the Silk Road. The investments included within this initiative for the most part fall under the label of “green energy.” However, through "green" hydropower development in the Lower Mekong Basin, the initiatives of the People's Democratic Republic have led to tens of thousands of cases of human displacement, wide spread damage to communities, the eradication of common sources of employment, and irreparable damage to the ecological diversity of the Mekong river. This paper examines the key aspects of environmental harm brought on by the construction of dams in local states through state-owned Chinese businesses. After analysis, it considers: To what extent is China culpable for the damages that they have inflicted upon the Lower Mekong Basin under the principle of <i>sic utere</i> in international environmental law?

		<hr>
		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> Human Rights Watch, Freedom House, the China Tribunal, both houses of Congress, the United States Department of State, and its Secretary have all agreed that Falun Gong practitioners are being persecuted on account of their religious practices in the People’s Democratic Republic of China. Given that the reality of ongoing persecution against Falun Gong practitioners is accepted by numerous governmental agencies and NGOs in the U.S. what does the fact that Falun Gong applicants for asylum are still being denied in the United States say about our asylum process?

		<h2 style="margin-left:100px; margin-right:100px;">Conjoint Pluralism in Poland and Ukraine</h2>
		<hr>
		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> Internal resistance to totalitarian communism through cultural pluralism severely limited regime efforts for ideological hegemonization and the repression of intellectual freedom in communist Poland and Ukraine. One central factor which diverted the Communist Party’s ideological control over the masses in Poland and the Ukraine is the unwavering religious faith held by the nations Orthodox Christian and Roman Catholic majorities. The Soviet hierarchy’s Marxist-Leninist Scientific Atheist belief system (which they enforced in a militant manner through the destruction of numerous churches and the creation of anti-religious museums) truly detached them from the majority of those under their leadership who held the Christian Faith. To this extent, the societal rift between the ruling class and the people in both countries was in part the fault of this ideology which both encompassed the entire party-state system and served as a prerequisite to power in most cases. How does one reconcile this and what balancing act must be performed in order for this rift to be stabilized? This question was never answered during the time that communism ruled in Eastern Europe. However, its effect, the common realization of the people of Ukraine and Poland that they as a people were distinct from those who led them embedded within them a sense of detachment which propelled them directly to social alienation of the leadership and an “us versus them” mentality flourished as the leadership detached themselves from the people.

		<h2 style="margin-left:300px; margin-right:300px;">Religion as an Aid to Democracy</h2>
		<hr>
		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> Together, Poland and Ukraine represent two states which have emerged from communist undemocratic tyranny through the efforts of civil society. This force unifies citizens within states so that through their joined efforts, they provide organizations that reflect their collective passions and bind themselves in a fraternal nature. Beginning in the era of communism in Poland and Ukraine to now, three decades following its collapse: What is the necessary role that religious institutions as civil society organizations have and must play in order for the furtherance of democracy to be made manifest?

		<h2 style="margin-left:300px; margin-right:300px;">The Physical Effects of "Scientific Atheism"</h2>
		<hr>
		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> The Soviet Union was founded in direct protest of the authority structures of the past. One such structure was the Church which gave legitimization to the previous Tsarist government. Therefore, the leadership within the Soviet Union sought to delegitimize the legitimizer by attacking religion and discrediting it. In their efforts to remove religion from the public sphere 1) millions of clergy and lay faithful where put to death, imprisoned in GULAGs, and sent to mental hospitals 2) countless cathedrals, churches, and monasteries were destroyed 3) and in their place Atheist Museums of Anti-religion were established. This had an immense effect on the geography of the Soviet Union as is demonstrated by this presentation.

		<h2 style="margin-left:300px; margin-right:300px;">Transcript: Holodomor</h2>
		<hr>
		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> Holodomor refers to the starvation that millions of Ukrainians suffered and died through from 1932 to 1933. This starvation’s cause is rooted in the policy decisions of Joseph Stalin. Stalin was the General Secretary or leader of the Soviet Union from 1929 to 1953. During this time, Ukraine found herself as a member of this undemocratic republic.  With regard to its meaning, Holodomor is a single word composed of the Ukrainian words морити and голодом, which when conjoined translate to “death |or extermination| by starvation.” Since its perpetration in 1932, Holodomor has been the subject of intense international debate with issues ranging from its causes, to its status as a genocide, and even its very existence.

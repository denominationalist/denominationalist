		<hr>
		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> Together, Poland and Ukraine represent two states which have emerged from communist undemocratic tyranny through the efforts of civil society. This force unifies citizens within states so that through their joined efforts, they provide organizations that reflect their collective passions and bind themselves in a fraternal nature. Civil society is defined by its composition of clubs of all different assortments, recreational groups for those engaged in sport or play, a wide variety of aid and relief organizations and associations, and perhaps most importantly in the case of Eastern Europe, faith-based or religious institutions. Religion, represented denominationally in the Eastern European states of Poland and Ukraine by the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Eastern Catholic faiths, found itself in an integral role in Eastern Europe during this time. Under the Soviet Union and the numerous communist governments of satellite states, religious institutions served as some of the principal organizations of objection to this system of governance. Resistance to totalitarian communism through the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Eastern Catholic Churches in the era of communism in Poland and Ukraine severely limited regime efforts for ideological hegemonization and the repression of intellectual freedom. It is without doubt that the central factor which diverted the Communist Party’s ideological control over the masses in Poland and the Ukraine is the unwavering religious faith held by the nations Christian majorities. Today, the demographics of Ukraine and Poland reflect this unwavering faith as over 90% of the population within these states report to be Christian (“Most Central…”). Contrastly, the Soviet hierarchy’s Marxist-Leninist Scientific Atheist belief system (which they enforced in a militant manner through the destruction of numerous churches and the creation of anti-religious museums) was truly detached from the majority of those under their leadership who held the Christian Faith. This produced a common realization among the deeply religious people of Ukraine and Poland that they as a people were distinct from those who led them. Obviously these are not the fruits of democracy, a group of powerful individuals united in a minority ideology representing masses of people who hold a belief which diametrically conflicts with their citizens. The development of an “us versus them” mentality in Ukraine and Poland, especially one that was morality-based, came as a result of this conflict. Through the efforts of many martyrs and Saints in Ukraine and Poland from time time of communism to the time following communism’s collapse religious institutions have and continue to play an integral role in the continuing efforts for the cause of democracy in these states. Beginning in the era of communism in Poland and Ukraine to now, three decades following the collapse of communism: What is the necessary role that religious institutions as civil society organizations have and must play in order for the furtherance of democracy in Poland and Ukraine to be made manifest?

		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> In principio erat Verbum, et Verbum erat apud Deum, et Deus erat Verbum. Hoc erat in principio apud Deum. Omnia per ipsum facta sunt, et sine ipso factum est nihil quod factum est; in ipso vita erat, et vita erat lux hominum, et lux in tenebris lucet, et tenebrae eam non conprehenderunt. Fuit homo missus a Deo, cui nomen erat Iohannes; hic venit in testimonium ut testimonium perhiberet de lumine, ut omnes crederent per illum. Non erat ille lux, sed ut testimonium perhiberet de lumine. Erat lux vera, quae inluminat omnem hominem, venientem in mundum. In mundo erat, et mundus per ipsum factus est, et mundus eum non cognovit. In propria venit, et sui eum non receperunt. Quotquot autem receperunt eum, dedit eis potestatem filios Dei fieri, his, qui credunt in nomine eius, qui non ex sanguinibus neque ex voluntate carnis neque ex voluntate viri, sed ex Deo nati sunt. Et Verbum caro factum est et habitavit in nobis; et vidimus gloriam eius, gloriam quasi unigeniti a Patre, plenum gratiae et veritatis.

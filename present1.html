		  <p> Moscow was not only the capital of the Soviet Union, but also of a centuries old ecclesiastical jurisdiction presided over by prelates of the Orthodox Church since the Christianization of Rus in the days of Sts. Olga and Vladimir. The great city of Moscow is the spiritual capital of the Russian Orthodox Church presently, in the time of the Soviet Union, as well as during Tsarism. Christ the Savior Cathedral– whose colossal, golden onion dome puffs out high above the skyline– was a strong symbol of the Church erected by order of Tsar Alexander I.</p>
		  <br>
          <p> To the dismay of the Soviets, the temple served as an iconic representation of Russian Christianity. Therefore, with the advent of the Marxist-Leninist scientific atheist movement in Russia– which called for militant atheism and the disassembly of God from the USSR– one of the earliest targets was Christ the Savior Cathedral. In December of 1931, “Iron Lazar” Kaganovich ordered the demolition of this symbol by explosion. Before this, the interior was gutted and religious iconography destroyed. Its absence from the Moscow region lasted seven decades until being rebuilt in 2000.</p>

		  <p>Leningrad as it was known in the Soviet Union or Saint Petersburg (its traditional name) is the largest city in Northwestern Russia. Within the USSR it was host to the Museum of Atheism or– as it is commonly known– Saint Isaac’s Cathedral. This 330 foot tall Cathedral displayed both the might of the Church and of Atheism in two different historical periods. St. Isacc's was once the largest structure in Saint Petersburg for many years and the tallest religious structure in all of Russia. </p>
		  <br>
          <p>During the Soviet era, the Cathedral was transformed– along with many others– to museums promoting anti-religion. The structure contained a number of pieces which displayed presented flaws in religious belief including a 299 foot long Foucault's Pendulum which was used as a teaching device to explain the Earth’s rotations. Many religious believers were taken to the museums as a method of re-education against religion in Soviet times.</p>

		  <p>The Solovetsky Monastery rests on an archipelago close to the Arctic Circle. For hundreds of years it was the home to a vibrant monastic community. This changed, however, when in 1922 it was repossessed by the Soviet Government. The resident monks, who numbered a few hundred, were either exiled or in the case of its superior, murdered. Its remote location within the the North Sea made it an ideal location for a prison against those who dissented against the ideology of the USSR.</p>
		  <br>
          <p>The "Solovki prison camp," as it was known, was home to many dissenters who were persecuted for their religious faith. Within this camp Christian figures of many denominations were persecuted in great numbers. Prisoners included Blessed Leonid Feodorov, a prominent Bishop and Exarch of the Russian Greek Catholic Church. Prisoners were isolated on the 134 square mile island known by many as “the mother of the GULAG” for many years as they labored for the creation of a canal. Prisoners occupied the previous structure of the monastery residing within the cloisters.</p>

		  <p>One famed GULAG within the Soviet Union was the Dubravlag Camp within the Mordovian ASSR. The region is now a part of the Northwestern Yavas region within the Mordovian Republic of the Russian Federation. This encampment was founded in 1948 as a holding place for political prisoners. Workers of the camp were forced into brutal manual labor which led to countless deaths. Within camps such as this, during the purges of Joseph Stalin, hundreds of thousands of christian clergy perished as a result of forced labor and outright execution.</p>
		  <br>
          <p>Regardless of the position of certain individuals in society– and in most cases because of this– religious belief was met with severe punishment. Prominent prisoners of the Dubravlag labor camp due to religious convictions included Metropolitan Corneliu, leader of the the Estonian Orthodox Church and Josyf Slipyj, the leader of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church.</p>

		  <p>When Christianity first came to Rus it did so through Kiev at the Baptism of St. Vladimir. The Saint Volodymyr's Cathedral within Ukraine's capital, Kiev commemorates this. The Cathedral has been the seat of the governance of the Russian and Ukrainian Orthodox Churches within Ukraine for centuries. It stands at 161 feet in the air through its numerous massive bell towers. Because of its grand structure and historical Christian significance it is another example of the wide scale destruction of religion within the Soviet Union.</p>
		  <br>
          <p>During the time of the Soviet Union the Cathedral was permanently closed and served as another anti-religious atheism museum which showcased devices and productions which defamed and desecrated traditional religions. The Cathedral’s massive golden bell was demolished by orders of the Soviets as an attack against religion to assert the dominance of state atheism. It is no doubt that the closure of this colossal historic building was in the spirit of the dechristianization of the Soviet Union, a power which had inherited an immensely Christian territorial history.</p>

		  <p>Dnipropetrovsk Regional Psychiatric Hospital is located within the Dnipropetrovsk (Dnipro) Ukrainian Socialist Republic. This hospital is a classic example of the politicization and weaponization of psychiatry by the Soviet Government. Patients were taken in from all over the Soviet Republic after being processed through the Serbsky Central Research Institute for Forensic Psychiatry in Saint Petersburg.</p>
		  <br>
          <p>Through the belief system of Scientific Atheism in the USSR– as advocated by the Marxist-Leninists–, religious belief was treated as a mental illness. This resulted in religious believers being committed or institutionalized in Psikhushka due to their supernatural convictions. The result of this was thousands processed through this and many being detained indefinitely. Religious individuals were diagnosed with "sluggish schizophrenia" and many other invented diagnoses.</p>

		  <p>A classic example of the transition of Churches from the hands of religious institutions to the state is the case of St. Clement's Roman Catholic Church. The Church of St. Clement within Sevastopol, Ukraine was seized from the Roman Catholics during the persecution of Christianity within the USSR. Its location within the closed city of Sevastopol in the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic displays the wide jurisdiction of the Moscow-based anti-religious authorities.</p>
		  <br>
          <p>As is evidenced by the seizing of this temple, Catholicism was specifically targeted by the Soviet Authorities due to their desire for elimination of religion in Russia. This Church, like many during this period, was turned into a cinema which displayed films for the local young population. A common theme of religious structures seized by the state was their reconstruction into swimming pools, cinemas, or– most notably– public bathrooms.</p>

		  <p>The Alexander Nevsky Cathedral was once the largest religious structure in the Caucasus Mountains. It was located within Azerbaijan’s capital of Baku. In the nineteenth century, its massive tower spiraled up 265 feet into the air. Baku, while composed of a vast majority of ethnic Muslim Azerbaijanis, was home to many Russian Orthodox Christian immigrants who constructed this church.</p>
		  <br>
          <p>Like Christ the Savior Cathedral in Moscow, it was deconstructed in 1937 by the order of Joseph Stalin to cleanse the Soviet Union of religion through explosives. Its destruction aided the Soviet authorities in displaying the grandeur of the "Baku Hall," the seat of Communist government, the Executive Committee of the Baku City Workers' Deputies Council. This was not the only Church to fall in Baku. Saint Thaddeus and Bartholomew Cathedral, a colossal structure was also exploded before this Cathedral.</p>

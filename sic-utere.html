		<hr>
		<p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> Currently, the People’s Republic of China is involved in an international investment known as the Belt and Road Initiative. This initiative involves China expanding its influence over the Belt and Road region, a historic region practically synonymous with the Silk Road. The investments included within this initiative for the most part fall under the label of “green energy.” China’s focus seems to be on expanding its green energy contributions abroad while also financially benefiting from the development of those energy investments in neighboring states. One investment in particular is hydroelectric energy which is in short dam production. These dams would be located in several waterways in Asia but mostly are to be and have been constructed in the Mekong River. The Mekong, one of Asia’s largest rivers, spans some 2,870 miles, flowing through China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. Beginning as the Lancang in China, this river rushes down through the other Asian states, providing a source of life relied upon by fisheries, farmers, shop owners, and those settled along its banks. While hydropower facility construction is known as green energy as it produces no carbon footprint after construction, the environmental effects of such construction can not be further from green. Currently, neighboring states who have accepted Chinese built dams run by Chinese state-owned and operated firms are facing extreme cases of serious environmental destruction caused by these facilities. Numerous species of fish, the livelihoods of those who farm them, victims of floods caused by dam reservoir construction are all testament to the reality of the consequences of dam construction. This work assesses China’s influence in expanding its Belt and Road initiative through the construction of hydropower facilities which have wreaked havoc along neighboring territory in the Mekong River in the context of international environmental law. In particular, the current interpretation of the principle of sic utere under the Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, better known as the Stockholm Declaration. As the letter of the law in this principle dictates, if China was to be blamed for the destruction of livelihoods, communities, and animal life that its endeavors have caused, they would be incapable of being prosecuted under the principle of sic utere because the destruction alluded to is occurring in foreign territory that is not their own. However, the reality of the situation is that there exist certain circumstances in this instance which merit a new interpretation of this principle of sic utere- the employment of the spirit of the law- in order to take into account environmental destruction caused by state-owned enterprises, led by state actors in foreign territory to carry out the agenda of the initiator state. 
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> Environmental degradation caused by the People's Republic of China through their Belt and Road Initiative in the matter of hydropower dam construction is a topic that is neglected in the literature of many environmental scholars. This gap is produced for two primary reasons, the first being that the benefits of this initiative are usually stressed to outweigh serious costs which will be elaborated on further to follow. The second reason for this gap would be the utter specificity of this issue leading those in their field of study to potentially mistake or overlook it as a niche issue when instead degradation in this region impacts the majority of the world’s population. 
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> In the realm of legality, considerations of the principles of international law and the structure of the development of international law to combat the issues that are being raised through further development of hydropower facilities are similarly lacking. However, some scholarship does exist which points to the need for further development of treaties and other vehicles for the formation of broader international legislation. This legislation primarily falls upon the sector of international economics as the Belt and Road Initiative is, afterall, an economic initiative that receives accolades through its environmental focus. It is unfortunate, however, that this environmental focus does not seem to produce developments in the sphere of international environmental law.
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> In an effort to provide both information and context with regard to the current structure of international law as it pertains to this issue a number of scholarly sources will be consulted.The framework of international law must first be evaluated and discussed in order to provide the reader with certain theoretical and conceptual ideas relevant to international law. In an effort to introduce these general ideas and provide precedent for their use in this work a chapter of “States and International Law” by Professor Mark Janis of the University of Connecticut School of Law is utilized. Therein, the structure of international law, concepts of state sovereignty, and the dilemma that arises due to the conjoinment of the two is explained.
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> Furthermore, in the tune of the previous article’s injection into this work on the grounds that it will better serve the reader in understanding key theories and concepts in international law, the arguments of Professor David Ong of Nottingham Law School will be utilized. Specifically, his codification of current claims on international environmental law. Through the employment of these concepts, the current interpretation of a founding principle in international environmental law that being, the principle of sic utere, can be exposed as lacking to combat the challenges that China’s actions pose to the existing legal framework’s ability to administer justice.
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> From the perspective of internal Chinese scholars on the development of the Belt and Road Initiative, special attention will be given to the arguments of Professor Liang Haoguang, the Executive Dean of the China Academy of the Belt and Road Initiative, Dean of Central and Eastern Europe Research Centre, Ministry of Education and Dean of Capital Development Institute of China. Within his nominal work, “The Theoretical System of Belt and Road Initiative,” Professor Haoguang elaborates on the need for legislation, potentially international legislation, to be utilized in order to meet the new challenges posed by the initiative. This can be seen in his own words quoted from the work in review that, “we [China] should use international legal means and existing mechanisms to resolve the legal problems hindering the implementation [of] the Belt and Road strategy”<sup>1</sup>. However, the desire for international law to be used in this area comes for the purpose of minimizing “investment risk” as opposed to the use and formation formulation of legislation to combat environmental degradation produced through the initiative. This facet of Professor Haoguang’s argument is exemplified in his push for “a new overseas investment management law to prevent enterprises from committing illegal acts abroad ”<sup>1</sup>.the substance of the Professor’s arguments as they pertain to the utilization of international law is skewed in that his focus is on investment security as opposed to the minimization of environmental degradation, the framework of his arguments of the need for international law to be utilized can be employed to meet the challenges imposed by the latter issue.
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> An important theoretical concept which is embedded in the main argument and thesis of this work is the distinction between the letter and the spirit of the law. These two methods by which compliance with laws are evaluated are biblical and go back to the story of Cain and Abel. The distinction between the two revolves around one’s following or interpretation of a commandment or law. If obedience or interpretation is out of regard for a literal following of the law in the fashion that it is inscribed, then one is indeed following the letter of the law. However, there is an important divide in which one might follow the letter of the law yet dodge the meaning of why the law was put into place and thus disobey it through a roundabout method or course of action. In order to introduce this concept, the arguments of Profs. Stephen M. Garcia of the University of Michigan and Patricia Chen of Stamford as well as Matthew T. Gordon in their work “The letter versus the spirit of the law: A lay perspective on culpability.”
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> In order to educate the reader on the environmental consequences of China’s Belt and Road Initiative, the ways in which these specific hydropower developments impact the environments of the states they are produced in will be discussed. Scholarly papers to be utilized include works such as a piece from the journal Science, “Environment and Development. Mekong Hydropower Development” by Dr. Edward Grumbine of the Kunming Institute of Botany’s Centre for Mountain Ecosystem Studies at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. In this work, Dr. Grumbine discusses and provides data to support his claims that the consequences of China’s acceleration in producing hydropower facilities throughout the Lower Mekong Basin are extremely destructive to those states. This argument is then utilized to showcase culpability on the part of China and serve as grounds for the prosecution of the People’s Republic for the destruction of numerous states' environments.
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> Furthermore, the effects of the point of primary concern- that being a lack of international environmental law-in the overarching discussion of the scope of this paper will be further elaborated on through the employment of journalistic reporting. Journalistic articles will be utilized to highlight the specific instances of environmental degradation. They will stress the inevitability of degradation given both the current interpretation of and utter lack of the existence of international environmental law relevant to the Belt and Road Initiative of the People’s Republic of China. Specifically,  a work to be employed is one of Shiban Mahtani’s, a Southeast Asia correspondent reporting for the Washington Post, entitled “The Mekong River Basin is Under Threat. Chinese Damming Projects and Climate Change Are to Blame.” This work will cast light on the effects of Chinese-led hydropower construction in Laos' Mekong tributary of Nam Ou. It will portray that in the absence of sound legislation to protect the environments of bordering states from companies run by the Chinese government, mass destruction has plagued the environments of bordering states. Specific attention will be placed on the ability for Chinese government run enterprises to inject themselves into states within the Lower Mekong Basin and act without impunity to carry out the interests of the Chinese government.
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> Similarly, stemming from the international implications of hydropower construction, an article written by Hannah Beech, the Southeast Asia bureau chief for the New York Times, “'Our River Was Like a God': How Dams and China's Might Imperil the Mekong. into bordering Cambodia through ” will be reviewed. Therein, the development of Chinese hydropower plants within Cambodia will highlight consequences of hydropower construction and the expansion of Chinese interests into other states within Asia. Specifically, the concept that China is responsible for legal environmental degradation in other states will be introduced with a focus on accountability.
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> A case study in dam construction along the Mekong, the Manwan Dam in the Lancang region of the river within China is also utilized in this work. The study produced by Professor Bryan Tilt, an environmental anthropologist at Oregon State University, utilizes a plethora of statistics to argue the negative consequences of dam construction. It’s data will be measured along with its central claim on environmental degradation through hydropower dam construction.
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> Collectively, these sources will portray China as a dangerous monopolizer of the Mekong and display that through the state’s international actions, serious environmental degradation has been and will continue to be produced. They will further the main argument of this paper in that they will showcase the culpability of China in these acts of international degradation, they will display the current silence in the law on the issue of Chinese accountability for degradation, and they will expose the faults of a current legal precedent in its inability to lay blame where it is due for degradation on an international level.
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> All states carry out their actions domestically and internationally in an effort to serve their national interests. However, there comes a time when the preservation of national interests and the pursuit of various goals which benefit states are set into a course in which conflict with other states is inevitable. The evident principle of state power, sovereignty, that a "state ought to be able to govern itself, free from outside interference" so too extend into this dilemma and states and put into conflict with one another<sup>2</sup>. In these instances a platform for states to civilly resolve their differences through adjudication has been developed through the discipline of international law. The next issue to arise through international disputes is that both state sovereignty and international law are “apparently antagonistic” in that judgments for and against various states restrict their power<sup>2</sup>. Because of the knowledge that in the present age states will, in many instances, have to answer to the international community or bereaved states who were wronged through their various illicit actions such actions are usually carried out in such a way that they are disguised. Not disguised in that the actions are subtle or carried out by others for them, while this may be the case, instead- actions take on brand names that are welcoming and illusive such as “green.” Furthermore, knowledge of the law allows for states to be crafty in their ability to chart a course of action which in effect might not interfere with the letter of the law but in application the spirit of the law is disregarded. In the People’s Republic of China efforts to further control along the Mekong River Basin are this very case.
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> According to those within the hierarchy of Chinese academia the Belt and Road Initiative is nothing short of charity that’s “construction has great significance for China in that it accelerates the formation of mechanisms that promote innovation, fosters coordination, advocates greening, lays a solid foundation for openness, and encourages sharing [between states]” <sup>1</sup>. While sharing, ‘greening,’ and openness are significant niceties which portray the initiative in a beautiful light they do not speak to its reality or substance. Only in passing is the true substance of the initiative alluded to where its aims are made bare:
    <p style="margin-left:90px; margin-right:70px;"> To perpetuate the vision of the times and address the realities of increasingly frequent global exchanges and increasingly in-depth global governance, Belt and Road theoretical construction must contemplate China’s development in combination with the development of various countries along the Belt and Road route and human society as a whole, link the problems experienced with China’s reform and opening up with the challenges of peaceful development resolution, master the history and culture of Belt and Road in the context of contemporary international political realities, and explore Belt and Road construction based on the law of all-inclusiveness to promote the development of the undertaking for human progress<sup>1</sup>.
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> In other words, Belt and Road is a global governance initiative which expands Beijing's sphere of influence into other states “along the Belt and Road Route.” It is then a highly calculated measure to allow China to profit off of her neighbors while appearing to export its contributions. The gain, in the realm of hydroelectric power is more access to waterways such as the Mekong River to power China and produce sources of income for the Chinese state abroad through power generation.
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> As the world’s most populous state as well as a state whose economy is continuing to expand, China has an intense desire to maximise its own interests as all others. Energy production and reserves from all sources seems to be a priority of great precedence. It is energy which empowers economies, societies, political and military ventures. Without energy there is no ability to grow, only to wither away. One must first understand this in order to grasp the international goals of the People’s Republic of China with relation to hydropower construction in Asia. Currently, China has been experimenting with widespread dam construction along it’s Lancang river which flows directly into and is the beginning stretch of the Mekong<sup>3</sup>. China’s involvement within the Mekong itself has been accuratly described by envinronmetal activists such as Pianporn Deetes as treating the Mekong as “not a river, but a laboratory,” an expression which should prompt the question “a laboratory to test what?”<sup>4</sup> In 2015 through the creation of the “Belt and Road Initiative” by the National Development and Reform Commission, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Ministry of Commerce of the People’s Republic of China, the Republic announced its plans to expand their international influence in Asia and around the world. Through constructing the term the “Silk Road Spirit” which is defined by the government to mean “peace and cooperation, openness and inclusiveness, mutual learning and mutual benefit,” China seeks to further enter into the affairs of the states of Asia and other states truely for their own benefit<sup>5</sup>.  After a great list of formalities and other pompous phrases akin to “Silk Road Spirit” within the full text of the initiative, the Chinese government explicitly mentioned their desire for “advance[d] cooperation in hydropower”<sup>5</sup>.  While this is not further developed within the text, shortly after the release of this promulgation, Chinese state-owned companies such as Sinohydro began planning hydropower facility construction within the Mekong, specifically within Laos in the Nam Ou tributary<sup>4</sup>. Through construction of hydropower facilities in cooperation with China, Laos hopes to be hailed as “the battery of Asia” but in truth will become the battery of China, to be used up in terms of its own natural resources, exhausted of its energy to fuel the expansionist People’s Republic of China<sup>4</sup>. This is the goal of China's Mekong laboratory, the further expansion of its energy capacity and production regardless of the costs of such development and strain on other nations and those who reside and depend on this river for their livelihoods.
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> The “Belt and Road Initiative” is more than just a way for Chinese businesses to increase their investment abilities throughout the world. The initiative allows for an increase in capital investments in many nations however, China’s dealings in Asia- specifically with Mekong region states are the object of great political interest as well. China’s international work brought on by the “Belt and Road Initiative” in Laos has led to the construction of many dams. There are currently 60 within their stretch of the Mekong with another 63 under work<sup>4</sup>. Within one village of Muang Khua, a region located within the Nam Ou tributary of the Mekong river, Sinohydro is busy at work acting as ambassadors of the Chinese government. Sinohydro or Power China International Group Limited is a hydropower company currently involved in producing a number of dams within Laos and all over Asia<sup>6</sup>. However, Sinohydro is not headquartered in this state but instead is based in Beijing, under the direct control of the Chinese government<sup>6</sup>. Their management team is run much akin to the People’s Republic, in that there are party officials on their board and a chairman who maintains all operations<sup>6</sup>. The “Belt and Road Initiative” has allowed for government officials from the People’s Republic of China to begin constructing assets in foriegn territories as if they were private businesses. These assets (dams) are paid for by those occupied foriegn countries, compensating China while the residents of these occupied states suffer the impacts.
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> In Muang Khua, the previously mentioned region within Laos, Sinohydro’s involvement was nothing short of hostile as at the start of 2020. Representatives from the Chinese owned business paid a visit to the river village alerting residents to leave or they “will be flooded out”<sup>4</sup>. It is as if, and is indeed, Chinese officials are evicting members of bordering countries to advance their own domestic economic gaims. Sinohydro representatives have yet to pay a followup visit to the village still occupied by the previously alerted villagers. As such, confusion reigns among the inhabitants who are unsure of what to do. This expression of confusion can best be seen in a statement collected from one boatman within the village who states, "we have no idea if we can stay here or if we have to leave"<sup>4</sup>. As the foriegn company has yet to return to the village, his guess is as good as anyone’s. Unfortunately, the effects of getting this wager wrong however can be fatal, with no help from the government potential flash floods caused by damming could be catastrophic for local residents. 
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> Within Cambodia, a new $800 million hydropower facility ‘Lower Sesan 2’ has decimated the village of Srekor.  Its “Chinese-built turbines'” began producing energy last December, and since then five villages have been flooded due to reservoir overflow<sup>7</sup>. This facility and the flooded villages serve as further proof of why further construction of hydropower facilities are greatly destructive for communities who have them foisted upon them. Hydropower facilities along the Mekong in Cambodia can power the entire nation themselves- however, frequent outages occuring in the region suggest power being sourced predominantly to neighboring China<sup>7</sup>. Therefore, construction has been a double edged sword with China benefiting from both the construction and production of these facilities. Currently, 80% of Cambodian’s protein intake comes from the Mekong, a river relied upon this heavily can not be risked losing as a result of power construction<sup>7</sup>.
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> The environmental effects of constructing a dam are manifold as hydropower facilities are massive industrial projects that have the sole intentional effect of trapping freely flowing river water and converting it into energy. The very process of power generation involves water, and all that resides within it, passing through the dam’s turbines where its force is converted into energy. This is obviously problematic as the first concern one must surmise when speaking of trapped river water is the fate of resident fish. The Mekong River harbors the second-highest fish species diversity in the world with 781 known species, and as a direct result of constructing hydropower facilities, coutless fish could perish as a result of development<sup>8</sup>.
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> From a social standpoint, the general loss of fish would be altogether catastrophic for the residents of the Mekong as fish-dependent diets within Cambodia and Laos would mean a loss of up to 30% of residents annual protein intake<sup>12</sup>.. Furthermore, for Lower Mekong Basin (LMB) countries the Mekong River Commission's Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) projects that roughly 2.1 million people would suffer direct and indirect losses to their livelihoods as a result of fish loss<sup>12</sup>. In addition to this, food security issues would further complicate social strife in LMB countries contributing to an increase in poverty and mortality. The Mekong river is “the most productive inland fishery in the world,” however increased hydropower development has the potential to wipe LMB nations off the map<sup>12</sup>.  With a tremendous loss of fish resulting from hydropower construction not only will Mekong residents lose a vital food source they will also lose an important commodity which many rely on for their livelihood. It is projected that dam construction would relinquish  $476 million annually for fish production in the economy<sup>8</sup>. Furthermore, fish related industries including boating, fishing, tackle manufacturing, salt production, ice production, and up‐stream industries including fish processing (manufacturing of fish sauce, dried fish and other fish products) would meet a  $2-4 billion decline. Stemming from these economic impacts, it has been determined through the SEA that LMB hydropower projects due to their destructive nature “would likely contribute to a growing inequality and a short to medium term worsening of LMB poverty in LMB countries''<sup>8</sup>.  This directly displays that the net result of construction of hydropower facilities is negative as their increased production would adversely affect the nation’s gini coefficient.  Furthermore, no link between hydropower revenue generation and poverty alleviation in LMB countries has yet to be found, further demonstrating the movement of profit is away from LMB residents, displaying a parasitic relationship by predominantly Chinese hydropower companies and local residents<sup>8</sup>. Altogether many massive industries will be decimated by hydropower construction, industries that commoners rely upon, becoming poverty-stricken in their wake.
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> A direct effect of construction is the increase of flooding as a result of the very existence of dams. There are a plethora of joint effects that come along with this flooding including land destruction, government compensation discrepancies, and most importantly relocation. Within the Lancang, the Manwan Dam serves as one of the best examples of intra-national consequences of hydropower within China. The reservoir or the accumulated body of water contained before the dam covers an area of 23.6 km2, a massive region equivalent to 9.11 square miles<sup>3</sup>. After its completion, 1.6 square miles of farmland and 2.2 square miles of woodlands were inundated with water as a result of flooding. In total, 114 villages in 8 townships and 4 counties were subjected to serious effects resulting from hydropower facility construction<sup>3</sup>. Furthermore, before the dam was constructed there was to be an estimated 3,052 farmers displaced by the construction. In actuality, 7.260 were displaced, double the estimate<sup>3</sup>. Similar environmental consequences included a 71.6% loss of orchard land in a region where fruit trees provided “a major source of cash income prior to inundation”<sup>3</sup>. In the same lense of economics, before hydropower construction was underway, the per-capita income of residents was 6.7% higher than the provincial average<sup>3</sup>. Following construction and flooding per-capita income in the reservoir region was down below 46.7% of the provincial average<sup>3</sup>. The totality of the data here expressed showcases the negative effects stemming directly from one almost unavoidable consequence of hydropower construction, the process of flooding. Because of the very nature of hydropower facility construction, the need for reservoirs, flooding will always occur because of development. It is impossible to divorce flooding from being an effect of development.
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> Having presented the facts on widespread current damage and potential damage inflicted on and to be inflicted on the environments of other states through China’s Belt and Road Initiative and displayed how it is Chinese companies owned and operated by the communist state who are carrying out these tasks abroad, the legality of these actions must now be analysed. Currently, International Environmental Law is blatantly underdeveloped as the states of the world have, up until the last few hundred years, not engaged in heavy industry to such an extent that the environments of states were degraded by their actions. This stands in stark contrast to the codified and complex statutes of international law in other disciplines such as war. Human beings have engaged in war or interstate conflict since the beginning of their tribalistic nature took hold. This has allowed for the natural progression of the codification of law to develop and after many a century it amounts to a fairly substantial assortment of ordered legislative doctrines.  The natural progression of international law goes as follows; initially, states form non binding agreements on certain facets of their relations, these agreements are then accepted and turned into treaties, lastly, they may be further codified and accepted by a broader community of states. It must be stressed that this is a naturally slow progression however.
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> In the case of international environmental law, the first agreement that brought states together with regard to international rules on the environment was the Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in 1972. Under this declaration, the principle of sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas was articulated to be accepted by states. The literal translation of this principle is, “dispose of [or use] your own property in a way so that you do not damage what is others.” That is to say, that states possess a “responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other states or areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction”<sup>9</sup>. This responsibility in line with their control is the foundational and overarching principle in this discipline of law. According to the Principle 21 of this declaration, “States have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental policies, and the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction”<sup>10</sup>. China was among some of the earliest states to sign, ratify, and enter this declaration into force. In November of 2004, China entered the Stockholm Declaration into force within the People’s Republic some two years before Cambodia and Laos who both did the same in 2006<sup>10</sup>. However, in practice China has not altered her environmental endeavors in such a way that environmental degradation to other states can be avoided.
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> If one was to analyse this principle in the context of China’s external degradation in the Lower Mekong Basin, they would arrive at the conclusion that as the law stands China can not be prosecuted for destruction if such a suit was raised. Because China is a sovereign state they are responsible for the damage they inflict on the environments of other sovereign states through their domestic action. However, it is not domestic action that has caused environmental destruction within the scope of the research presented in this work. Instead, it was foreign investment policy which was carried out by state actors in bordering states. China is not responsible for damages caused beyond the limits of her own national jurisdiction. While through the research presented, the environments of Laos and Cambodia have been greatly damaged by the introduction of hydropower facilities constructed by Chinese workers, designed by Chinese engineers who were obviously financed through China, governed and executed by Chinese companies like Sinohydro which are owned and operated by the Chinese government this is not in violation of sic utere if the letter of the law were to be the only measure to pass judgement on China.
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> In reference to true justice being served one’s own knowledge of worldly affairs informs them that the letter of the law can be followed while transgressions against its spirit remain. A 2014 study on judgement and decision making by a group of academics found that to the perception of the majority of humans studied,“what matters above and beyond the mere letter [of law] is whether the spirit of the law—namely, the perceived intention of the letter—has been violated”<sup>11</sup>. While this finding is small it casts great light upon the opinion of those who pass judgement on what is deemed appropriate to constitute violation of law. This also expands upon the necessity for the spirit of the law to be considered when passing such judgements. If in fact this view, that the spirit of the law matters above and beyond its letter, that is to say that the intention of the law holds great significance, why should it be excluded from consideration in passing judgement in international law?
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> In the course of these events in which the fish populations of Laos and Cambodia are and can further be decimated, the livelihoods of those who produce boats and products of all the fruits of the river are erased, even swaths of territory are being erased through flooding due to the further development of hydropower facilities— the question becomes is environmental degradation not occurring? The answer to this intentionally rhetorical question is an obvious, ‘of course it is.’ Because there is indeed international environmental destruction occurring, next the question of fault becomes of foremost importance. As has already been highlighted, this degradation is the result of the investment initiative of a foreign power, namely China. While an interpretation of the principle of sic utere under the letter of the law in which China is not causing harm in its own territory is preserved the reality of their fault for the degradation is made unprosecutable. This inability for prosecution, it must be stressed, is not because of any innocence but because of nothing short of error in the legal system though interpretation. Therefore, the spirit of the law, the perceived intention of the law must then be accounted for as justice is impared when an obvious reality is barred from being exposed.
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> A modification of the Stockholm Declaration’s twenty-first principle, the codified and accepted basis for sic utere in international environmental law is not necessary. However, a change in interpretation to account for its spirit is required in order for the obvious degradation to be prosecuted if such a case were to be brought. When the principle references responsibility in that states must “ensure that activities within their... control do not cause damage to the environment of other States” the control referenced must be interpreted to encompass the actions of Chinese state owned companies and their agents, who have --in the case of the events in Muang Khua- served as state actors in evicting residents from their homeland. The control that China possesses in neighboring nations within the Lower Mekong Basin while not an act of illicit cession or occupation does however constitute environmental responsibility for the actions carried out that negatively impact other states.
    <p style="margin-left:10px; margin-right:10px; text-indent:10px;"><b>Methodology</b>
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> In an effort to accurately display the reality of environmental degradation in the Lower Mekong River Basin numerous facts were employed in this work. Data from previous instances of flooding as a result of hydropower facility construction, fish loss in Laos and Cambodia, projections on loss of livelihood and economic consequences due to further development in these LMR states were also gathered. Furthermore, facts on the current nature of international law were employed as definitions. Facts included within this work pertaining to environmental degradation came from a wide variety of sources. News publications were consulted for environmental damage in the Mekong River in Laos and Cambodia; these sources were obtained through the Washington Post and the New York Times. Other sources in this category were academic journals such as Science as well as various books produced on the effects of hydropower facilities in the Mekong accessed through the PRIMO database. Sources which pertain to facts on the structure of international law were obtained through both the course material and the United Nations website.
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> Because environmental damage caused by hydropower facilities is an ongoing issue in the Lower Mekong Basin, data utilized is limited to that which is extant in the news cycle and academic works. While there might be ways of finding more current information about the effects of certain dams in the LMR this requires presence or contacts within this region which are not possessed by the author. In reviewing the data collected on the current state of degradation of LMR states through China’s Belt and Road Initiative, one can reasonably conclude that the effects of this initiative have been catastrophic on these states. It is only through the figures and facts expressed through statistics and projections that one is made aware of this reality. Furthermore, in reviewing the structure of the international legal principle in dispute in the context of this issue one can again, reasonably, conclude that were a hypothetical trial be held, China would not be culpable for destruction under international environmental law at present if the interpretation of the letter of the law was utilized.
    <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; text-indent:50px;"> Current actions undertaken by the Chinese government through their Belt and Road Initiative have caused serious environmental harm to States on the Lower Mekong Basin. Not only have major decreases in fish life been initiated, the expulsion of native populations from their lands through flooding and flood devastation harming the natural environment have, among many other factors, contributed to great environmental degradation in the states within this region. Currently, as the law stands, as China’s efforts have been undertaken within other states they are not subject to the principle of sic utere in which they would be held responsible for destruction in other states’ territory caused by them. However, this continuously referenced degradation is at the fault of the People’s Republic. Chinese hydropower facilities have caused this destruction in other sovereign states, these facilities are built by and controlled by Chinese companies, these companies are controlled by the Chinese government, and the directive to ‘invest in’ or develop dams in LMR states was authored by the Chinese government and is an official foreign policy directive. In that all these factors have been considered, an interpretation of the principle of sic utere under the spirit of the law in which states are held accountable for damage they inflicted onto other states’ sovereign territory, given the circumstances, is the only way for this issue in international law to be both heard and adjudicated.
